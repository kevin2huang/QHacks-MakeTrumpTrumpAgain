A lot of times --

And our country is going to hell.


I actually think I have the best temperament. I'm not the one with the trigger. Other people up here, believe me, would be a lot faster.

If you noticed, he didn't answer your question. We're going win with Trump. And people back down with Trump.

Yes, and he wants to be a tough guy and it doesn’t work very well with --

Let me talk. Quiet.

-- a lot of times -- a lot of times -- that's all of his donors and special interests out there.

So it's what it is.


I loved it. It was a great debate. We had some fun. I had a great time and I'm very happy with the results. It was terrific.

Not a parking lot.

Good.

And you know what I did?

I let the court stand as opposed to going higher up.

But let me -- we could have gone higher. But let me just tell you, George, I decided not to do it. I decided not to pursue it. We could have --

-- doesn't matter. We could have gone a different way. I offered her a lot of money. She ended up selling the house for much less money than I offered her.

Eminent domain is a very important thing. Jeb Bush doesn't understand what it means. And if you look into the Bush family -- I found this out five minutes ago. They used eminent domain for the stadium in Texas, where they own, I guess, a piece of the Texas Rangers.

That doesn't matter. It was the Bush family. They used private eminent domain. He didn't tell anybody this. So I mean, he should have told people. Maybe -- he probably doesn't know because I don't even think he knows what eminent domain is. But I just found that out five minutes ago.

Eminent domain is important. You wouldn't have highways, you wouldn’t have roadways, you wouldn’t have bridges, you wouldn’t have hospitals. You wouldn't have anything without it.

The Keystone Pipeline, everybody wants the Keystone Pipeline. If you're a conservative, you want the Keystone Pipeline. They have a whole section on eminent domain. When they write up, the whole thing, on the Keystone. They have a whole section right now --

The crowd was on my side except they were all friends of mine that were donors and special interests and lobbyists, some of whom worked for me in the past.

It was -- actually, it was a very -- it shows how broken the system is. The people in that audience were the people that were supporting all of the candidates. I'm the only candidate not taking money. I'm not taking money.

I had supporters. I had 20 tickets. I mean, they gave me 20 tickets.

Hey, George, all of those people in that crowd, 90 percent of them were people that gave to the various candidates and mostly to Bush.

Look, Bush got $128 million. He's nowhere. He spent over $100 million on this failed campaign of his. And he's nowhere. Those people were in the audience. So every time anybody said anything, in fact, Rubio actually said, he said, why does nobody get any response but Bush?

I just think it's really showing the system. When you have somebody like me, where I don't take money, where I'm a self-funder, people really appreciate that. And that's why I brought it out last night. It was a good point, I think. But I brought it out last night.

Well, George, you're not talking about what I said before that. I said we're living in a world where, in the Middle East, they're cutting people's heads off. They're chopping a Christian's head off. And many of them, we talk about Foley, James Foley, and you know, what a wonderful young man. Boom, they're chopping heads.

So then I went into this. I said, yes, I would bring back waterboarding. And I would make it a hell of a lot worse than waterboarding.

I had in mind going worse than waterboarding. It's enough. We have right now a country that's under siege. It's under siege from a people, from -- we're like living in medieval times. If I have it to do and if it's up to me, I would absolutely bring back waterboarding. And if it's going to be tougher than waterboarding, I would bring that back, too.

I would absolutely authorize something beyond waterboarding. And believe me, it will be effective. If we need information, George, you have our enemy cutting heads off of Christians and plenty of others, by the hundreds, by the thousands.

Yes. I'm sorry. You have to do it that way. And I'm not sure everybody agrees with me. I guess a lot of people don't. We are living in a time that's as evil as any time that there has ever been. You know, when I was a young man, I studied Medieval times. That's what they did, they chopped off heads. That's what we have...

We're going to do things beyond waterboarding perhaps, if that happens to come. The question was asked. I thought Ted's answer was very tentative, Ted Cruz. He gave a very tentative answer. If we have to, we're going to have to do more.

But when you have conditions like that, I would say absolutely, I would approve waterboarding and if you go beyond it, I'm OK with that.

Right.

Well, no, you had to have it reclassified. You reclassify and you'll see what happens.

But I would certainly approve waterboarding. They laugh at us. Our enemies laugh at us, George. They say waterboarding, they don't even think it's a form -- you know, they don't even view that as real torture.

But they say waterboarding and they chop off heads. They think we are so stupid, you have no idea. The enemy that we are fighting -- and no wonder they're doing so well, because with this kind of thinking, that's why they're doing so well.

In 2003-2004, I was against the war. That's probably the first time. Now, again, I wasn't a politician, George. I'm not somebody that you would interview. I was a businessman.

You probably

But the point is -- yes, I was, actually. Maybe I should have done it. I like this one better. I like this time better.

But the fact is that in 2003-2004, I was very much opposed to the Iraq War. I said it's going to destabilize the Middle East. It exactly destabilized the Middle East.

Well, you can. And, you know, again, we're going to bring people together. And that's your thing and other people have their thing. We have to bring all people together. And if we don't, we're not going to have a country anymore.


I'm talking about bringing people together and we -- I would appoint justices. It would take a long time, frankly, because I don't know how long it would take to appoint a...

If they -- if they -- I would appoint them and we will see how they will vote but I would...

We'll find out. I mean we're going to find out. There's a lot of people that want to see that. But I would, I'd -- more important than anything else to me, this country is so divided right now, as per her question. This country is so totally divided, it's probably almost never been as divided as it is right now and we have to bring it together.

It has -- it has really been determined and we will see what happens. We're going to look at judges. They've got to be great judges. They've got to be conservative judges. We're going to see how they stand depending on -- on what their views are.

But that would be my preference.

I would prefer that they stand against it, but we'll see what happens. It depends on the judge.

Well, I think what will happen is -- and, look, George, it's very simple. We're going to bring our country together. We're going to unify our country. We're going to do whatever we have to do. I'm going to put the absolute bed -- best judges in position. If their views -- we're going to see what their views are. I will make the determination at that time.

Well, I think I understand what they're saying and we're going to see what happens. It's a long way off, George. It's a long way off.

I think we're doing well. I think it's going well. I think our ground forces are good. I think I had a good debate last night.

Well, I think I did very well in Iowa. I came in first or second, depending on how you want to count the Carson vote. I mean depending on how you want to count that, I came in either first or second out of originally 17 people.

Well, I'll tell you what, if you add up all of the thousands of votes that were added onto Cruz, you know, you'll see what happens. I mean I think I might have come in better than second.

But it doesn't matter. I think second a very good finish.

You know, Rubio came in third. Every -- everybody was saying what a great job he did. I came in second and they said, oh, he had a bad performance.

And I said why is that bad?

I mean I came in second, he came in third, he was good and I wasn't?

I don't know. I mean, I don't know. He had a rough time, but, you know, we'll see what happens. I mean we have a -- an interesting two days ahead. But I wanted to get by the debate. People said I won the debate. Almost everybody said I won the debate. Even you said I did well.

And we'll see what happens.

I don't know. It's a long way to go, George. To me, it's a long way to go. I mean I see these wonderful poll numbers, but they don't mean anything to me. I just don't know about polls. I don't know if they're accurate. When they interview 300 people and then they come up with this brilliant poll, to me, the people in New Hampshire have to get out, have to vote and hopefully they're going to vote for Trump, because I'm going to do a good job.

Thank you.

Thank you.

Thank you.

Thank you very much.
