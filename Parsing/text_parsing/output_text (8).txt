He is a nervous basket case. Here is a guy -- you ought to see him backstage. He was putting on makeup with a trowel. No, I don't want to say that. I will not say that he was trying to cover up his ears. I will not say that.

Out of nowhere, he goes -- on live television, here is how he respond, he choked just like he did with -- he's a choker. He choked with Chris, and all of a sudden, he is being drained. And he goes like this. Remember? I said where is he? And then he comes back with water. And, honestly, water is fine, but it should be in a glass. He's got the label of the company here and he is drinking. Honestly, I have never seen anything like it. It's Rubio!

I thought he was going to die, Rubio. He was so scared, like a little frightened puppy.

He was sweating so badly, I have never seen anything like it. It looked like he just jumped into a swimming pool with his clothing on.

He's a choker.

Rubio is a baby.

Really weak on illegal immigration.

Basket case.

It's not easy running for president. You get low lives like a guy like Rubio saying horrible things. And who needs it? Really, who needs it?

It's something I could have settled many times. I could settle it right now for very little money, but I don't want to do it out of principle.

The people that took the course all signed most many, many signed report cards saying it was fantastic, it was wonderful, it was beautiful. I spend and believe me, I'll win that case. That's an easy case, a civil case.

At Trump University we teach success. That's what it's all about. Success. It's going to happen to you.

I think the biggest step toward success is going to be sign up at Trump University.
