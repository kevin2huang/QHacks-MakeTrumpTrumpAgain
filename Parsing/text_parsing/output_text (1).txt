I have no idea how I'll do. Maybe I'll do terribly. Maybe I'll do great.

Thank you, Jon.

Well, I think it's a real possibility because what she did was absolutely, in my opinion, illegal and I don't think she's going to be allowed to run if they have a prosecutor who's going to be honorable because if you look at Gen. Petraeus, what he did is nothing compared to what she's done. And his life is in ruins.

I mean, what they've done to him is incredible and very, very tough. And what she did is far worse.

So I think she's got a big problem with the emails and obviously her numbers are going down drastically so somebody like Biden could probably go in and do very well and maybe win.

Well, I'm not a debater. These politicians I always say, they're all talk, no action. They debate all the time. They go out and they debate every night. I don't debate. I build I've created tremendous jobs. I've built a great company. I do a lot of things.

And maybe my whole life is a debate, in a way. But the fact is I'm not a debater and they are. But with that being said, I look forward to it. We'll see what happens. Who knows?

I don't think I'm going to be throwing punches. I'm not looking to attack them. Don't forget, every single attack 

Yes, every attack I made was a counter punch. I mean, they attacked me first and I hit them back and maybe harder than they hit me. But the fact is that I've been attacked pretty viciously by some of these guys. And I have a lot of respect for numerous people on the stage. I will tell you, I have great respect for some of the people on the stage.

But I have been attacked and I counter punch. I didn't start the attacks.

Well, I mean, he may say that. You know, he's very weak on the military. He's very weak on defense. And I think that's probably hurt him very badly. I think he's a nice guy. I've contributed a lot of money to his cause, where he goes around as a doctor and he goes around and takes care of some very seriously ill people and helps them out.

And I've made a lot of contributions. So I was a little bit surprised to hear him say that and maybe it was built up by the press. But I would say that I was a little surprised to hear Rand say that.

But if he's feels that, that's OK with me.

It's a very simple answer to that. I was a business man all my life. I've made a tremendous fortune. I had to deal with politicians and I would contribute to them and I would deal with them and certainly I'm not going to say bad things about people because I needed their support to get projects done. I needed their support for lots of things or I may have needed their support, put it another way.

I mean, you're not going to say horrible things and then go in a year later and say listen, can I have your support for this project or this development or this business. So I say nice about almost everybody and I contributed to people because I was a smart business man. I've built a tremendous company. And I did that based on relationships.

Now I'm no longer a business man. Now I'm somebody that wants to make our country great. And the tone is too weak. You know, they're telling me and Jeb I understand what he's saying. He said the tone, the tone. And Hillary used the exact SAE word, the tone of Trump.

But we need a tough tone. They're beheading our people in I mean, they're beheading Christians, the world is going no, but you know what? The tone has to be tougher. If we're going to stop ISIS, if we're going to clean up the border and stop what's happening at the border which is a disaster, which I was very proud to have brought up and took a lot of heat the first week, now everyone's apologizing to me because they see that I was right.

But we need a tougher tone. We can't have that tone anymore. We need a strong tone and we need tremendous enthusiasm and as you understand, Jeb doesn’t have that strong tone and he doesn’t have that level of enthusiasm that you need to make our country great again.

I feel strongly. But as a business man, I support everybody. I supported everybody and I did very well doing it.

Well, I think he's been a very poor president. I think he has done a very poor job as president. We have $18 trillion right now in debt and going up rapidly.

Wait a minute.

The world is we don't have victories anymore. China is killing us on trade. Mexico's killing us at the border and also killing us on trade. Mexico's doing unbelievably against us in trade.

You look at what's going on with Japan. You look at what's going on with Vietnam. You look at Saudi Arabia, makes $1 billion a day and we defend them. We get nothing.

Because I think that he has set a very poor standard. I think that he has set a very low bar and I think it's a shame for the African American people.

And by the way, he has done nothing for African Americans. You look at what's gone on with their income levels. You look at what's gone on with their youth. I thought that he would be a great cheerleader for this country. I thought he'd do a fabulous job for the African American citizens of this country.

He has done nothing. They are worse now than just about ever and they are excuse me. They have problems now in terms of unemployment numbers, look at their unemployment numbers. And you have here you have a black president who's done very poorly for the African Americans of this country.

And I think that I will win the African American vote and I think I will win the Hispanic vote. And if you see the recent polls that came out, Jon, you'll see that because I'm leading in the Hispanic vote.

Well, I have a number of people that I like. But I will say this, when it comes to the Supreme Court, I'd want high intellect, and I'd want very conservative. I would like really high intellect and very conservative.

I would be inclined to be very strong. When people are chopping off other people's heads and then we're worried about waterboarding and we can't, because I have no doubt that that works. I have absolutely no doubt.

you mention waterboarding, which was such a big subject. I haven't heard that term in a year now, because when you see the other side chopping off heads, waterboarding doesn't sound very severe.

I wouldn't want to put any names out there right now. I think it's far too early. I want to see. And I'm certainly looking at the field. And there are certainly some tremendous people that we could put in, but it would be somebody that's very strong, very smart, and you know what else would be important, very energetic. You need a lot of energy.

Well, I don't think she'd want to, because at the the answer is you know, I like Sarah Palin a lot. I think Sarah Palin has got the very unfair press. I think the press has treated her very unfairly. But I would pick somebody that would be a terrific you know, you have to view it as really who would be a good president in case something happened. But I would there are many, many people out there that I think would be very good.

I will tell you this, I am leading in every poll, and in some cases by a tremendous margin, and people are a little bit surprised, but I'm not surprised. And people that know me aren't surprised, because they see what's going on with this country.

If I'm treated fairly by and don't win, but if I'm treated fairly by the Republican Party, I would have no interest in doing that. If I'm not treated fairly by the Republican Party, I very well might consider that. And I would certainly not give that up.

Thank you very much.
