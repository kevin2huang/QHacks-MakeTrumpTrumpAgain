	"But a lot of people said that.",
	"Then, I did have a meeting with the editorial board of the New York Times, a very nice meeting.",

	"Is it going to be 45 feet or 40 feet? That could very well be.",
	"That could very well -- he wants it to be higher.",
	"That could very well be.",
	"But there's always give and take.",
	"And the best negotiator that knows what he's doing will make a great deal.",
	"But we need give and take in government.",
	"If you don't have give and take, you're never going to agree on anything.",
	"I will say one thing, what Marco said is -- I understand it.",

	"We may differ on the degree.",
	"But what he said to me is OK.",
	"I never do that.",
	"I would not do that.",
	"I don't think -- I have too much respect -- if I deal with you off the record, if I deal with Bret or Chris off the record, I have too much respect for that process to say, just release everything.",

	"They'll go to Harvard, they'll go to Stanford, they'll go to Wharton, as soon as they're finished they'll get shoved out.",
	"They want to stay in this country.",
	"They want to stay here desperately, they're not able to stay here.",
	"For that purpose, we absolutely have to be able to keep the brain power in this country.",
	"I'm changing it, and I'm softening the position because we have to have talented people in this country.",
	"No, I'm not playing.",

	"Approved by government in Palm Beach, or West Palm Beach.",
	"We bring people in, we bring them out.",
	"We want to hire as many Americans as we can, but they don't want part-time, very short part-time jobs.",
	"The -- the -- the other hotels during the season, they do the same thing.",
	"They take in a lot of people, because you can't get them.",
	"They take in a lot of people.",
	"Long-term employees, we don't do that, but short-term employees, we have no choice but to do it, and other hotels in that very, very hot area.",
	"It is a very hot area.",
	"It's very, very hard to get people.",
	"But other hotels do the exact same thing.",
	"And just so you understand, just again, this is a legal process.",
	"This is a procedure.",
	"It's part of the law.",
	"I take advantage of that.",
	"There's nothing wrong with it.",
	"We have no choice.",
	"This wasn't on the subject.",
	"Tapes were not on the subject, but that's",
	"You're the lying guy up here.",
	"You're the -- you're the one.",
	"Now, let me just tell you.",
	"Let me just tell you.",

	"I've given my answer.",
	"They're not going to refuse me.",
	"Let me just tell you, you look at the Middle East.",
	"They're chopping off heads.",
	"They're chopping off the heads of Christians and anybody else that happens to be in the way.",
	"They're drowning people in steel cages.",
	"And he -- now we're talking about waterboarding.",
	"This really started with Ted, a question was asked of Ted last -- two debates ago about waterboarding.",
	"And Ted was, you know, having a hard time with that question, to be totally honest with you.",
	"They then came to me, what do you think of waterboarding? I said it's fine.",
	"And if we want to go stronger, I'd go stronger, too, because, frankly",
	"that's the way I feel.",
	"Can you imagine -- can you imagine these people, these animals over in the Middle East, that chop off heads, sitting around talking and seeing that we're having a hard problem with waterboarding? We should go for waterboarding and we should go tougher than waterboarding.",
	"And -- and -- and -- I'm a leader.",
	"I've always been a leader.",
	"I've never had any problem leading people.",
	"If I say do it, they're going to do it.",

	"The wife knew exactly what was happening.",
	"They left two days early, with respect to the World Trade Center, and they went back to where they went, and they watched their husband on television flying into the World Trade Center, flying into the Pentagon, and probably trying to fly into the White House, except we had some very, very brave souls on that third plane.",

	"But I would get the best people, people that I'd be comfortable with.",
	"And we will do the right thing.",
	"We've made a terrible mistake getting involved there in the first place.",
	"That thing will collapse about two seconds after they leave.",
	"Just as I said that Iraq was going to collapse after we leave.",
	"We made a mistake going into Iraq.",
	"I've never said we made a mistake",
	"Well, OK, I never said that.",
	"I never said it.",
	"Should I respond to that first?",
	"You'll be here a long time.",
	"I hate the concept of it, but on a humanitarian basis, with what's happening, you have to.",
	"It's living in Hell in Syria; there's no question about it.",
	"They're living in Hell.",
	"Look, from a humanitarian standpoint, I'd love to help, but we have our own problems.",
	"We have so many problems that we have to solve.",
	"They said there were weapons of mass destruction; there were none.",
	"And they knew there were none.",
	"I don't know if he lied or not.",
	"He could have lied.",
	"I guess you'd have to ask him.",
	"Well, on Afghanistan, I did mean Iraq.",
	"I think you have to stay in Afghanistan for a while, because of the fact that you're right next to Pakistan, which has nuclear weapons, and we have to protect that.",
	"Nuclear weapons change the game.",
	"And I was always against going into Iraq.",
	"In fact, I -- believe me, I was always against it.",
	"There was some cases where I sort of -- in one interview with a great friend of mine, and yours, Howard Stern -- said that -- said that",
	"I said very meekly, long before we went in, I said very meekly, well, maybe, maybe, I don't know.",
	"By the time it got to that point, I was always against Iraq.",
	"But Afghanistan, I felt -- and in that one, if you notice, I corrected it the second day.",
	"OK? Second question? KELLY: There are several examples, Mr.",
	"Now on -- let me explain that.",
	"First time the question had been put to me, it was very early on.",
	"The migration had just started.",
	"And I had heard that the number was a very, very small number.",
	"By the second day, two or three days later, I heard the number was going to be thousands and thousands of people.",
	"You know, when they originally heard about it, they were talking about bringing very, very small numbers in.",
	"And I said, begrudgingly, well, I guess maybe that's OK.",
	"It was not like, Let's bring them in, because I think we should build a safe zone in -- we should really -- what we should be doing is building safe zones so they can stay in their own country and not go all over, and at least this way we're not going to have the problem.",
	"That's what we have to do.",
	"But just -- just to set -- because I fully understand what you're asking.",
	"When I first heard the question, first time the question was ever asked to me, first time I really had known about the question, the migration had just started.",
	"I was very much like, OK, by the time I went back and studied it, and they were talking about bringing thousands and thousands, I changed my tune.",
	"And I don't think there's anything wrong with that.",
	"Megyn, I have a very strong core.",
	"I have a very strong core.",
	"But I've never seen a successful person who wasn't flexible, who didn't have a certain degree of flexibility.",
	"You have to have a certain degree of flexibility.",
	"You can't -- for instance, let's say, on -- on the second question, you can't say it's OK, and then you find out it's not OK, and you don't want to do anything.",
	"You have to be flexible, because you learn.",
	"I mean, before I knew the question was asked by Bill, and the next day, or the couple of days later, the question was asked by, by -- you know -- I was asked by a number of people, actually.",
	"I was asked by Sean, but I was asked by a number of people.",
	"But by that time, the number had increased significantly.",
	"But I had learned.",
	"I mean, nobody had ever asked me the question.",
	"This was brand new.",
	"But -- and I really mean it.",
	"You have to show a degree of flexibility.",
	"If you're going to be one way and you think it's wrong, does that mean the rest of your life you have to go in the wrong direction because you don't want to change?",
	"There should be a lot of systems beyond databases.",
	"We should have a lot of systems.",
	"And today you can do it would be just good management.",
	"I do want a database for those people coming in.",
	"I want surveillance if we have to.",
	"I want surveillance of certain mosques, OK?",
	"I don’t know, I don’t think about it.",
	"I think about the date, all of a sudden, February 1st comes, that’s Iowa, and then we have New Hampshire.",
	"We’re doing great in both those places.",
	"We’re doing great all over the country; I think I’m leading every state.",
	"But we’re doing really well.",
	"I was happy to hear your numbers but I’m not that surprised.",
	"And we’ll see what happens.",
	"I mean, people are tired, they’re sick and tired of incompetence.",
	"They’re sick and tired of stupid people leading them, the deals they make, whether it’s trade or whether it’s dealing with ISIS, everything is wrong.",
	"But they don’t know what they’re doing.",
	"I was after the oil.",
	"I said attack the oil.",
	"I’ve been telling you that, George, for two years, attack the oil.",
	"They didn’t do it.",
	"ISIS became wealthy with the oil.",
	"Now they’re starting to attack the oil.",
	"Nobody mentions it was me.",
	"No, not at all.",
	"I want a database for the refugees that if they come into the country.",
	"We have no idea who these people are.",
	"When the Syrian refugees are going to start pouring into this country, we don’t know if they’re ISIS, we don’t know if it’s a Trojan horse.",
	"And I definitely want a database and other checks and balances.",
	"We want to go with watchlists.",
	"We want to go with databases.",
	"And we have no choice.",
	"We have no idea who’s being sent in here.",
	"This could be the it’s probably not, but it could be the great Trojan horse of all time, where they come in.",
	"When I look at those migration when I look at the migration and the lines and I see all strong, very powerful looking men, they’re men and I see very few women, I see very few children, there’s something strange going on.",
	"And if you look at what’s happened in Europe, a lot of bad things are happening in Europe.",
	"Just ask the folks that live in Germany, George.",
	"A lot of bad things are happening.",
	"We want to be smart.",
	"We want to hey, George, we want to be vigilant.",
	"We have to be vigilant and we have to call is radical you know, we have to just say it.",
	"It’s radical Islamic terrorism, and that’s what it is.",
	"And we have a president that won’t even issue the term.",
	"But when these Syrians come in, or wherever they are, because we’re not even sure that they’re coming in from Syria, if they’re going to come in, we have to be very, very vigilant.",
	"And a database would be fine for them and a watchlist is fine.",
	"We have to watch and see what we’re doing.",
	"They should not come in, by the way.",
	"They should not be allowed to come in.",
	"Well, we have to be strong.",
	"You know, they don’t use waterboarding over there; they use chopping off people’s heads.",
	"They use drowning people.",
	"I don’t know if you’ve seen with the cages, where they put people in cages and they drown them in the ocean and they lift out the cage.",
	"And we’re talking about waterboarding.",
	"We have to be tough",
	"We have to I would bring it back, yes.",
	"I would bring it back.",
	"I think waterboarding is peanuts compared to what they’d do to us, what they’re doing to us, what they did to James Foley when they chopped off his head.",
	"That’s a whole different level and I would absolutely bring back interrogation and strong interrogation.",
	"Well, Jeb Bush is a weak person and that’s been defined very strongly.",
	"I mean, Jeb is a weak person who is a you know, I call him a low energy person.",
	"That’s what he is.",
	"I mean, call him anything you want, but Jeb is a person that will not solve a problem like this.",
	"You have very, very tough people that you’re dealing with.",
	"They only understand strength.",
	"They don’t understand weakness.",
	"Somebody like Jeb, and others that are running against me and by the way Hillary is another one.",
	"I mean, Hillary is a person who doesn’t have the strength or the stamina, in my opinion, to be president.",
	"She doesn’t have strength or stamina.",
	"She’s not a strong enough person to be president.",
	"We’re dealing with very George, we’re dealing with very, very strong people.",
	"And you need strength and you need stamina.",
	"Hillary does not have that.",
	"Well, I don’t want to close mosques; I want to surveil mosques.",
	"I want mosques surveiled.",
	"We were doing it New York City for a while until the worst mayor that New York City has ever had got elected",
	"De Blasio, which was a fluke.",
	"And all I would do, certainly there are certain hot spots and everybody knows they’re hot spots.",
	"And let me tell you, the people that are involved in those mosques, they know who the bad ones are and they know who the good ones are, but they don’t talk.",
	"And we have to surveil the mosques and we were doing it.",
	"We were doing it recently until De Blasio closed them up in New York City.",
	"We were doing it recently.",
	"We have to surveil the mosques.",
	"And big material and good material, from what I understood, from a very good source, was coming out of those mosques.",
	"We were learning a lot.",
	"And they were stopping problems and potential problems by learning what was happening.",
	"Hey, look, I don’t want to close up mosques but things have to happen where, if you’ve got you have got to use strong measures or you’re going to see buildings coming down all over New York City and elsewhere.",
	"We have to have a watchlist, and if that watchlist has somebody that’s you know, we have you know, we have the laws right now.",
	"We have the laws already on the books as far as Second Amendment for guns, and as you know I’m a big, big, really big proponent of the Second Amendment.",
	"If in I’ll give you an example.",
	"If in Paris some of those people, those and if you had some of those people had guns, you wouldn't have had the horror show that you had with nobody",
	"out of hundreds of people had guns",
	"You if people are on a watch list or people are sick, you have already this is already covered in the legislation that we already have, George.",
	"It's already fully covered.",
	"if we have an enemy of state",
	"Listen, George, if we have an enemy of state, I don't want to give him anything.",
	"I want to have him in jail, that's what I want.",
	"I want to have him in jail.",
	"But if those people in Paris had guns in that room, it would have been a shootout and very few people would have been hurt by comparison to the number that were hurt.",
	"I'll tell you who would have been hurt, the bad guys would",
	"because they were the only ones that had the guns.",
	"If somebody is on a watch list and an enemy of state and we know it's an enemy of state, I would keep them away, absolutely.",
	"Hey, I watched when the World Trade Center came tumbling down.",
	"And I watched in Jersey City, New Jersey, where thousands and thousands of people were cheering as that building was coming down.",
	"Thousands of people were cheering.",
	"It was on television.",
	"George, it did happen.",
	"There were people that were cheering on the other side of New Jersey, where you have large Arab populations.",
	"They were cheering as the World Trade Center came down.",
	"I know it might be not politically correct for you to talk about it, but there were people cheering as that building came down as those buildings came down.",
	"And that tells you something.",
	"It was well covered at the time, George.",
	"Now, I know they don't like to talk about it, but it was well covered at the time.",
	"There were people over in New Jersey that were watching it, a heavy Arab population, that were cheering as the buildings came down.",
	"John Kasich is going nowhere.",
	"He was the head of Lehman.",
	"He was one of the top people at Lehman when Lehman almost took down Lehman Brothers almost took down the world.",
	"Let him do his ads.",
	"Anybody that does an ad against me, it will hit by 10 times.",
	"And that's the story.",
	"you know, people would like to do look, they want to do itI think he was.",
	"I think he was actually being a divider because, you know, George, no matter how you cut it, you have people that are mentally ill and they have problems and they're going to slip through the cracks.",
	"And no matter how you do it, no matter how you try, and if you go back 2,000 years and if you go forward 2 million years, you're going to have problems.",
	"And it may not even be politically correct to say",
	"But what's interesting is the places, you look at Chicago, it's got the toughest gun laws in the United States, you look at other places where they have gun laws that are very tough, they do generally speaking worse than anybody else.",
	"I mean if you look at some of these places, Chicago's a good example, but go to Baltimore, go to various cities where they have very, very tough gun laws, they do terribly.",
	"I'm not passive at all.",
	"I can tell you that people say, oh, were going to stop it.",
	"It doesn't work that way.",
	"This has taken place whether it's this type of crime or other crimes, taken a place forever, from the beginning, and it's going you go out a million years from now, you're going to have problems.",
	"And even if you have a very tough system, you're going to have people that slip through the cracks.",
	"And it's a very sad situation and you have to great vigilance.",
	"I mean you have to show great vigilance and watch and be careful and security and everything else.",
	"But no matter what you do, you will have problems and that's the way the world goes.",
	"Yes, you're going to now, George, I could say, oh, were going to do this and that and it's never going to happen again.",
	"You have sick people in this country and throughout the world and you're always going to have difficulty.",
	"That's why you have newscasts.",
	"And I think I'll do a fabulous job.",
	"And I will make things a lot better.",
	"No matter what you do, you're going to have difficulties.",
	"People are going to slip through the cracks.",
	"Well, the gun laws have nothing to do with this.",
	"This is about really mental illness.",
	"And I feel very strongly about it.",
	"And, again, politically correct, oh, we're going to solve the problem, there will be no problem, et cetera, et cetera.",
	"You're always going to have difficulties, no matter how tight you run it.",
	"Even if you had great education having to do with mental illness, you educate the community, it's still, you're going to have people that slip through the cracks.",
	"And these people are more than slipping through the cracks.",
	"These people want to slip through the cracks.",
	"So you're going to have problems.",
	"What do they know? George, what do they know? I mean they've been doing this stuff for years.",
	"Can I tell you what? They've been doing this stuff for years.",
	"You look at their past projections, they are so far off.",
	"People this is a very dynamic plan.",
	"People are going well, if it works the way I want it to work it's not because we're going to bring back jobs.",
	"I am going to bring back so many jobs.",
	"One of the things that we're coming out with in the next three or four weeks is cutting.",
	"And the cutting is a big part of my plan.",
	"We're going to come up with very substantial cuts and",
	"The Department of Education.",
	"We're going to do cutting.",
	"And the economy is going to grow exponentially.",
	"It will cost me a lot of money.",
	"Well, I'll tell you what.",
	"I have carried interest, like a lot of other people do, and carried interest is a wonderful thing, but it's unfair",
	"And rich people are getting",
	"But it's psychologically so important.",
	"If the economy grows, we all make it up.",
	"I mean, frankly, the job producers make it up.",
	"The economy has to grow.",
	"And, by the way, we have to bring back jobs.",
	"Also part of my plan.",
	"Everybody's going to save, according to my plan, and that money you know where that money's going?",
	"That money is going back into other things.",
	"I don't know because I have very big deductions that are frankly some of them are ridiculous.",
	"You're entitled to deductions.",
	"So I don't know that I am.",
	"I think that probably I'll end up paying more under this.",
	"To be honest, I don't think I'm going to.",
	"If you look at all of the kinds of deductions that people are allowed to take, that you're not going to be taking anymore, including carried interest, that's just one of them, I think I probably don't do as well.",
	"Well, the estate tax is a different thing.",
	"The estate tax is a very, very horrible weapon that has destroyed many families.",
	"In particular, farms and things where they make an income and they have a certain value and they have to go out and borrow money and they put mortgages on their farms, they",
	"It's a big business.",
	"George, if you have a business, and let's say it's a business that's not very liquid, and people have to go out and borrow against the business, you are having travesty.",
	"And the other thing is, it's a double taxation.",
	"The tax has already been paid.",
	"I mean you've been hearing this argument for many years.",
	"No, no, I say it's a double taxation.",
	"It's a it's the death tax is an unfair tax because the tax has already been paid.",
	"I mean if the economy is good, if the economy is great, everybody makes out well so.",
	"Well, I'm thinking about it.",
	"I'm thinking about maybe when we find out the true story on Hillary's emails you know, I've been saying that for a while, let's find out the true stories.",
	"But you know what? I'm very honest with my tax returns.",
	"I'm not going to say it, but at some point I'll release it.",
	"But I pay as little as possible, I'm very proud to tell you.",
	"And I will say this, if this country were properly run, where the money wasn't in shambles, where the deals that they make aren't the Iran deal, where we're giving Iran 150 billion dollars and the deal is a disaster in every single possible way, where everything we do is bad, including ObamaCare, which is, by the way, the premiums are up 55 percent for some people.",
	"If our country was properly run, I'd almost feel much better about it, and so would a lot of other people.",
	"But I just want to say, I fight like hell to pay as little as possible.",
	"I used to watch Romney who, by the way, really let us down because he failed to win an election that he should have won easily.",
	"I used to watch him try and get his number as high as possible.",
	"It's not the way it works.",
	"I mean I fight because that's a very big expense.",
	"And one of the problems and one of the reasons I fight so hard is because I hate the way our country is spending my money and everybody else's money.",
	"I don't think so.",
	"I think what I want to do is I want to sit back and this does not sound like me very much but I want to sit back and I want to see what happens.",
	"You know, Russia got bogged down, when it was the Soviet Union, in Afghanistan.",
	"They thought that would be quick and easy and they'll go in and they'll clean it up, they can.",
	"Well, I think it's a I think it's not going to be great for them, if you want to know the truth.",
	"But let's just look, they got bogged down.",
	"It destroyed the Soviet Union.",
	"I mean they essentially went bankrupt.",
	"They it destroyed the Soviet Union, Afghanistan.",
	"Now they're going into Syria.",
	"There are so many traps.",
	"There are so many problems.",
	"When I heard they were going in to fight ISIS, I said, Great.",
	"But they don't want ISIS going into Russia, either.",
	"So they're not bombing them yet.",
	"And the other thing I look at is Assad.",
	"Assad's a bad guy, but they're all bad guys.",
	"You know, they talk about the Syria Free Rebels.",
	"We don't even know who they are.",
	"Well, I spoke to a general who's very, you know, much on he said, Mr.",
	"Trump, we have no idea who these people are.",
	"They may be worse than Assad.",
	"So we're going to spend all of this effort, all of this we'll probably have to go against Iran now.",
	"I mean and Iran, we're making Iran rich and powerful.",
	"You notice Iran now is coming in with the ground troops.",
	"They have 150 billion dollars.",
	"All of the sudden they're rich.",
	"The sanctions are gone.",
	"What we've done with Iran is one of the most incompetent things I've ever seen.",
	"So now, we have this and we don't.",
	"We're going to fight for people that we don't even know who they are.",
	"Now if you look at Libya, you look at Gadhafi, you look at what's gone on there, you look at Iraq, with Saddam Hussein, I mean do you think we're better off now, because I personally don't?",
	"Well, ABC was at my speech the other night in New Hampshire.",
	"A totally packed house, 4,000 people.",
	"It was a beautiful thing to see.",
	"And I gave a explained a very, you know, detailed explanation.",
	"And I'm going to give it to you right now.",
	"When I heard that I saw the migration.",
	"The migration was strange to me, because it seems like so many men.",
	"There aren't that many women.",
	"There aren't that many children.",
	"It looked like mostly men and they looked like strong men.",
	"These looked like physically strong people.",
	"And I'm saying, Where are all the women? Where are all the children?",
	"OK, and a lot of people.",
	"By the way, excuse me.",
	"A lot of people have said the same thing.",
	"But when I heard we were going to take in 3,000.",
	"which was the first number, as you know, then I heard we were going to take in 10,000, I sort of said Well, OK.",
	"Now I hear we want to take in 200,000.",
	"We don't know where they're coming from.",
	"We don't know who they are.",
	"They could be ISIS.",
	"It could be the great Trojan Horse.",
	"I mean this could be one of the great Trojan Horses ever, since the original.",
	"We don't know where these people they have no documentation.",
	"They have no paperwork.",
	"There's no way they can prove where they're coming from.",
	"And I'm saying we're going to take in 200,000 people that we have no idea where they come from?",
	"And I said I would absolutely not do it.",
	"I have a bigger heart than you do, OK, believe me.",
	"I have a very big heart and I understand the whole thing with migration.",
	"It's a horrible thing.",
	"It should have never happened in the first place.",
	"This country has screwed up the Middle East so badly, with breaking up Iraq.",
	"We have so destabilized the Middle East.",
	"It is a mess.",
	"So I said there's no way they come in.",
	"If they do come in, if I win for president, they're going out.",
	"And I tell them up front if I win now, I may not win.",
	"I may not even get the nomination, even though even you will admit I'm leading big league in every poll.",
	"But I may not.",
	"I mean a lot of things happen.",
	"If I win, they're going back.",
	"We are not going to take responsibility.",
	"Now are they ISIS?",
	"Probably not but nobody knows.",
	"And many of them.",
	"Look, they shouldn't take them In.",
	"Europe should take some probably, because you have the Gulf States.",
	"You have Saudi Arabia.",
	"You have you have Qatar.",
	"You have the some of the richest countries.",
	"They're not taking any and they're right there,",
	"So we're supposed to take 200,000 people that we have no idea who they are?",
	"So Melania is a very beautiful woman both inside and out.",
	"She has got a tremendous heart.",
	"She feels so strongly about the women's health issues, in fact, she knows how strongly I feel about that and she's always pushing me on women's health issues.",
	"When Jeb Bush said he's not going to fund women's health issues, that was a terrible she couldn't believe it.",
	"And she told me about it when I got home.",
	"He then said he misspoke and he made a mistake and he's going to.",
	"But she couldn't believe it.",
	"She would be so great on that.",
	"And so would Ivanka, Ivanka Trump.",
	"She feels the same way.",
	"And they both want me they said, dad, you have such respect for women, and they say, you cherish women.",
	"You have such respect for women, you've got to speak more about it, because there's nobody that cares more for women than you.",
	"My mother was one of the great people ever in my life that I've ever met.",
	"And I have just amazing admiration and respect for women.",
	"I think Melania would be unbelievable for women and for the country.",
	"Well I've had a lot of fun doing this and I guess it's more fun when you see the kind of polls that I'm getting.",
	"And I think they're now higher than ever.",
	"And a lot of that is dissent.",
	"I mean people are very, very unhappy with what's happened with politicians, how badly they're running the country.",
	"They're all talk no action.",
	"I've dealt with them all my life, believe me.",
	"You know that because you've covered me in my previous life.",
	"You've covered me for a long time.",
	"But I'm really enjoying what I'm doing.",
	"And I think we're having a very big impact.",
	"And one thing I'll say, a lot of people are watching that would not be watching.",
	"When you look at the debates, when you look at CNN, with 23 or 24 million people, they may have had a couple of million or four million, maybe.",
	"You look at Fox, with 24 plus million people.",
	"So I think I'm doing a great I think I'm doing a great service.",
	"Well it's not a question of polls.",
	"If I felt that I was doing badly, if I felt that the polls were and I think polls are reflective, I mean right now I love polls because I'm winning everything I'm even winning, we just got one from Florida, I'm killing the governor and the senator from Florida I mean it's been amazing.",
	"Winning everything, winning every state, winning every national poll and big lead.",
	"If that changed, and that went in a different direction and if I thought that I wasn't going to win, like there are numerous people running, they're not going to win, okay? I would certainly want to get out.",
	"I'm not a masochist.",
	"I'm not somebody that needs to do this for other reasons.",
	"If I thought I was doing poorly I would think I would want to do it.",
	"Now, I will say, right now I'm loving it, I'm having a lot of fun.",
	"And the most important thing is it's not a question of like, it's a question, I want to make America great again.",
	"We can make it great again George.",
	"And I think we can actually make it better than ever before.",
	"I've never said that but I think we can make it better than ever before.",
	"And that's what I'm most excited about.",
	"Not polls, I'm excited about the endgame, the endgame is making this country great again.",
	"I mean you just came out with a poll that says I'm leading.",
	"But everyone else is coming out with polls saying I'm leading because people are sick and tired of stupid and incompetent people leading our nation.",
	"We have incompetent people.",
	"When President Obama stands up and says ISIS is contained and then a few hours later, you have one of the most horrible attacks, where hundreds of people are killed, and you have 300 people laying in the hospital, many of them dying, they'll be added to the list of the people killed, and we have no idea.",
	"And then he wants to take in people that have no documentation, no paperwork, no anything from Syria on the migration.",
	"People are going to come pouring in.",
	"And the number he wants is much higher than 10,000.",
	"I've heard it's 200,000.",
	"That's the real number.",
	"That's the real number he wants.",
	"I've even heard 250,000 people.",
	"We have a president that doesn't know what he's doing.",
	"We have a president, George, who is totally incompetent.",
	"Well, we'll see what happens.",
	"It will be very interesting.",
	"But I'm leading every poll by a lot.",
	"It's not even a little bit anymore, it's a lot.",
	"And that's I resonate with the people.",
	"I had 10,000 people yesterday.",
	"Every place I go, if I have a crowd smaller than 10,000, it's like a small crowd for me.",
	"Nobody else can get 200,000.",
	"I mean Jeb Bush and these guys, Kasich goes out, he speaks, if he gets 20 people in ma room, it's a lot of people.",
	"Nobody else gets anybody and I get crowds.",
	"And you know it, you cover it.",
	"I get crowds of 6,000, 10,000, 20,000.",
	"I had a 35,000 crowd",
	"Well, I'm going to have to see what happens.",
	"I will see what happens.",
	"I have to be treated fairly.",
	"You know, when I did this, I said I have to be treated fairly.",
	"If I'm treated fairly, I'm fine.",
	"All I want to do is a level playing field.",
	"And I think people are surprised that, you know, they're politicians and they've been doing this stuff all their lives.",
	"I've been a job producer.",
	"I've done great, you know, things.",
	"I've done fabulous developments all over the world and I've made a lot of money.",
	"And that's the kind of thinking we need in office.",
	"That's the kind of thinking we need in Washington.",
	"And that's why people are resonating with me.",
	"And, you know, they know there's a great level of competence.",
	"We have a great level of incompetent right now in Washington.",
	"And frankly, we have a lot of incompetent politicians running for office.",
	"And they can't understand, you know, how come an outsider can be doing so well within the party.",
	"I used to be, George, the fair-haired boy.",
	"You know, when I was a contributor.",
	"I know more about contributions than anybody.",
	"I contributed at the top of the line.",
	"But now, all of a sudden, I'm somebody that's a little bit you know, they're a little bit I guess they cant understand what's happening.",
	"But what's happening is very simple.",
	"People want competence now.",
	"They're tired of incompetent people.",
	"It's as simple as that.",
	"Thank you very much.",
	"I think he was.",
	"I think he was actually being a divider because, you know, George, no matter how you cut it, you have people that are mentally ill and they have problems and they're going to slip through the cracks.",
	"And no matter how you do it, no matter how you try, and if you go back 2,000 years and if you go forward 2 million years, you're going to have problems.",
	"And it may not even be politically correct to say",
	"But what's interesting is the places, you look at Chicago, it's got the toughest gun laws in the United States, you look at other places where they have gun laws that are very tough, they do generally speaking worse than anybody else.",
	"I mean if you look at some of these places, Chicago's a good example, but go to Baltimore, go to various cities where they have very, very tough gun laws, they do terribly.",
	"I'm not passive at all.",
	"I can tell you that people say, oh, were going to stop it.",
	"It doesn't work that way.",
	"This has taken place whether it's this type of crime or other crimes, taken a place forever, from the beginning, and it's going you go out a million years from now, you're going to have problems.",
	"And even if you have a very tough system, you're going to have people that slip through the cracks.",
	"And it's a very sad situation and you have to great vigilance.",
	"I mean you have to show great vigilance and watch and be careful and security and everything else.",
	"But no matter what you do, you will have problems and that's the way the world goes.",
	"Yes, you're going to now, George, I could say, oh, were going to do this and that and it's never going to happen again.",
	"You have sick people in this country and throughout the world and you're always going to have difficulty.",
	"That's why you have newscasts.",
	"And I think I'll do a fabulous job.",
	"And I will make things a lot better.",
	"No matter what you do, you're going to have difficulties.",
	"People are going to slip through the cracks.",
	"Well, the gun laws have nothing to do with this.",
	"This is about really mental illness.",
	"And I feel very strongly about it.",
	"And, again, politically correct, oh, we're going to solve the problem, there will be no problem, et cetera, et cetera.",
	"You're always going to have difficulties, no matter how tight you run it.",
	"Even if you had great education having to do with mental illness, you educate the community, it's still, you're going to have people that slip through the cracks.",
	"And these people are more than slipping through the cracks.",
	"These people want to slip through the cracks.",
	"So you're going to have problems.",
	"What do they know? George, what do they know? I mean they've been doing this stuff for years.",
	"Can I tell you what? They've been doing this stuff for years.",
	"You look at their past projections, they are so far off.",
	"People this is a very dynamic plan.",
	"People are going well, if it works the way I want it to work it's not because we're going to bring back jobs.",
	"I am going to bring back so many jobs.",
	"One of the things that we're coming out with in the next three or four weeks is cutting.",
	"And the cutting is a big part of my plan.",
	"We're going to come up with very substantial cuts and",
	"The Department of Education.",
	"We're going to do cutting.",
	"And the economy is going to grow exponentially.",
	"It will cost me a lot of money.",
	"Well, I'll tell you what.",
	"I have carried interest, like a lot of other people do, and carried interest is a wonderful thing, but it's unfair",
	"And rich people are getting",
	"But it's psychologically so important.",
	"If the economy grows, we all make it up.",
	"I mean, frankly, the job producers make it up.",
	"The economy has to grow.",
	"And, by the way, we have to bring back jobs.",
	"Also part of my plan.",
	"Everybody's going to save, according to my plan, and that money you know where that money's going?",
	"That money is going back into other things.",
	"I don't know because I have very big deductions that are frankly some of them are ridiculous.",
	"You're entitled to deductions.",
	"So I don't know that I am.",
	"I think that probably I'll end up paying more under this.",
	"To be honest, I don't think I'm going to.",
	"If you look at all of the kinds of deductions that people are allowed to take, that you're not going to be taking anymore, including carried interest, that's just one of them, I think I probably don't do as well.",
	"Well, the estate tax is a different thing.",
	"The estate tax is a very, very horrible weapon that has destroyed many families.",
	"In particular, farms and things where they make an income and they have a certain value and they have to go out and borrow money and they put mortgages on their farms, they",
	"It's a big business.",
	"George, if you have a business, and let's say it's a business that's not very liquid, and people have to go out and borrow against the business, you are having travesty.",
	"And the other thing is, it's a double taxation.",
	"The tax has already been paid.",
	"I mean you've been hearing this argument for many years.",
	"No, no, I say it's a double taxation.",
	"It's a it's the death tax is an unfair tax because the tax has already been paid.",
	"I mean if the economy is good, if the economy is great, everybody makes out well so.",
	"Well, I'm thinking about it.",
	"I'm thinking about maybe when we find out the true story on Hillary's emails you know, I've been saying that for a while, let's find out the true stories.",
	"But you know what? I'm very honest with my tax returns.",
	"I'm not going to say it, but at some point I'll release it.",
	"But I pay as little as possible, I'm very proud to tell you.",
	"And I will say this, if this country were properly run, where the money wasn't in shambles, where the deals that they make aren't the Iran deal, where we're giving Iran 150 billion dollars and the deal is a disaster in every single possible way, where everything we do is bad, including ObamaCare, which is, by the way, the premiums are up 55 percent for some people.",
	"If our country was properly run, I'd almost feel much better about it, and so would a lot of other people.",
	"But I just want to say, I fight like hell to pay as little as possible.",
	"I used to watch Romney who, by the way, really let us down because he failed to win an election that he should have won easily.",
	"I used to watch him try and get his number as high as possible.",
	"It's not the way it works.",
	"I mean I fight because that's a very big expense.",
	"And one of the problems and one of the reasons I fight so hard is because I hate the way our country is spending my money and everybody else's money.",
	"I don't think so.",
	"I think what I want to do is I want to sit back and this does not sound like me very much but I want to sit back and I want to see what happens.",
	"You know, Russia got bogged down, when it was the Soviet Union, in Afghanistan.",
	"They thought that would be quick and easy and they'll go in and they'll clean it up, they can.",
	"Well, I think it's a I think it's not going to be great for them, if you want to know the truth.",
	"But let's just look, they got bogged down.",
	"It destroyed the Soviet Union.",
	"I mean they essentially went bankrupt.",
	"They it destroyed the Soviet Union, Afghanistan.",
	"Now they're going into Syria.",
	"There are so many traps.",
	"There are so many problems.",
	"When I heard they were going in to fight ISIS, I said, Great.",
	"But they don't want ISIS going into Russia, either.",
	"So they're not bombing them yet.",
	"And the other thing I look at is Assad.",
	"Assad's a bad guy, but they're all bad guys.",
	"You know, they talk about the Syria Free Rebels.",
	"We don't even know who they are.",
	"Well, I spoke to a general who's very, you know, much on he said, Mr.",
	"Trump, we have no idea who these people are.",
	"They may be worse than Assad.",
	"So we're going to spend all of this effort, all of this we'll probably have to go against Iran now.",
	"I mean and Iran, we're making Iran rich and powerful.",
	"You notice Iran now is coming in with the ground troops.",
	"They have 150 billion dollars.",
	"All of the sudden they're rich.",
	"The sanctions are gone.",
	"What we've done with Iran is one of the most incompetent things I've ever seen.",
	"So now, we have this and we don't.",
	"We're going to fight for people that we don't even know who they are.",
	"Now if you look at Libya, you look at Gadhafi, you look at what's gone on there, you look at Iraq, with Saddam Hussein, I mean do you think we're better off now, because I personally don't?",
	"Well, ABC was at my speech the other night in New Hampshire.",
	"A totally packed house, 4,000 people.",
	"It was a beautiful thing to see.",
	"And I gave a explained a very, you know, detailed explanation.",
	"And I'm going to give it to you right now.",
	"When I heard that I saw the migration.",
	"The migration was strange to me, because it seems like so many men.",
	"There aren't that many women.",
	"There aren't that many children.",
	"It looked like mostly men and they looked like strong men.",
	"These looked like physically strong people.",
	"And I'm saying, Where are all the women? Where are all the children?",
	"OK, and a lot of people.",
	"By the way, excuse me.",
	"A lot of people have said the same thing.",
	"But when I heard we were going to take in 3,000.",
	"which was the first number, as you know, then I heard we were going to take in 10,000, I sort of said Well, OK.",
	"Now I hear we want to take in 200,000.",
	"We don't know where they're coming from.",
	"We don't know who they are.",
	"They could be ISIS.",
	"It could be the great Trojan Horse.",
	"I mean this could be one of the great Trojan Horses ever, since the original.",
	"We don't know where these people they have no documentation.",
	"They have no paperwork.",
	"There's no way they can prove where they're coming from.",
	"And I'm saying we're going to take in 200,000 people that we have no idea where they come from?",
	"And I said I would absolutely not do it.",
	"I have a bigger heart than you do, OK, believe me.",
	"I have a very big heart and I understand the whole thing with migration.",
	"It's a horrible thing.",
	"It should have never happened in the first place.",
	"This country has screwed up the Middle East so badly, with breaking up Iraq.",
	"We have so destabilized the Middle East.",
	"It is a mess.",
	"So I said there's no way they come in.",
	"If they do come in, if I win for president, they're going out.",
	"And I tell them up front if I win now, I may not win.",
	"I may not even get the nomination, even though even you will admit I'm leading big league in every poll.",
	"But I may not.",
	"I mean a lot of things happen.",
	"If I win, they're going back.",
	"We are not going to take responsibility.",
	"Now are they ISIS?",
	"Probably not but nobody knows.",
	"And many of them.",
	"Look, they shouldn't take them In.",
	"Europe should take some probably, because you have the Gulf States.",
	"You have Saudi Arabia.",
	"You have you have Qatar.",
	"You have the some of the richest countries.",
	"They're not taking any and they're right there,",
	"So we're supposed to take 200,000 people that we have no idea who they are?",
	"So Melania is a very beautiful woman both inside and out.",
	"She has got a tremendous heart.",
	"She feels so strongly about the women's health issues, in fact, she knows how strongly I feel about that and she's always pushing me on women's health issues.",
	"When Jeb Bush said he's not going to fund women's health issues, that was a terrible she couldn't believe it.",
	"And she told me about it when I got home.",
	"He then said he misspoke and he made a mistake and he's going to.",
	"But she couldn't believe it.",
	"She would be so great on that.",
	"And so would Ivanka, Ivanka Trump.",
	"She feels the same way.",
	"And they both want me they said, dad, you have such respect for women, and they say, you cherish women.",
	"You have such respect for women, you've got to speak more about it, because there's nobody that cares more for women than you.",
	"My mother was one of the great people ever in my life that I've ever met.",
	"And I have just amazing admiration and respect for women.",
	"I think Melania would be unbelievable for women and for the country.",
	"Well I've had a lot of fun doing this and I guess it's more fun when you see the kind of polls that I'm getting.",
	"And I think they're now higher than ever.",
	"And a lot of that is dissent.",
	"I mean people are very, very unhappy with what's happened with politicians, how badly they're running the country.",
	"They're all talk no action.",
	"I've dealt with them all my life, believe me.",
	"You know that because you've covered me in my previous life.",
	"You've covered me for a long time.",
	"But I'm really enjoying what I'm doing.",
	"And I think we're having a very big impact.",
	"And one thing I'll say, a lot of people are watching that would not be watching.",
	"When you look at the debates, when you look at CNN, with 23 or 24 million people, they may have had a couple of million or four million, maybe.",
	"You look at Fox, with 24 plus million people.",
	"So I think I'm doing a great I think I'm doing a great service.",
	"Well it's not a question of polls.",
	"If I felt that I was doing badly, if I felt that the polls were and I think polls are reflective, I mean right now I love polls because I'm winning everything I'm even winning, we just got one from Florida, I'm killing the governor and the senator from Florida I mean it's been amazing.",
	"Winning everything, winning every state, winning every national poll and big lead.",
	"If that changed, and that went in a different direction and if I thought that I wasn't going to win, like there are numerous people running, they're not going to win, okay? I would certainly want to get out.",
	"I'm not a masochist.",
	"I'm not somebody that needs to do this for other reasons.",
	"If I thought I was doing poorly I would think I would want to do it.",
	"Now, I will say, right now I'm loving it, I'm having a lot of fun.",
	"And the most important thing is it's not a question of like, it's a question, I want to make America great again.",
	"We can make it great again George.",
	"And I think we can actually make it better than ever before.",
	"I've never said that but I think we can make it better than ever before.",
	"And that's what I'm most excited about.",
	"Not polls, I'm excited about the endgame, the endgame is making this country great again.",
	"My whole theme is make America great again.",
	"We don't win anymore as a country.",
	"We don't win with trade, we don't win with the military.",
	"ISIS, we can't even knock out ISIS, and we will, believe me.",
	"We don't win in any capacity with healthcare.",
	"We have terrible health care, Obamacare is going to be repealed and replaced.",
	"We just don't win.",
	"You look at our borders, they're like swiss cheese, everybody pours in.",
	"We're going to make a great country again.",
	"We're going to start winning again.",
	"We're going to win a lot, it's going to be a big difference, believe me.",
	"It's going to be a big difference.",
	"First of all, he was in charge of amnesty, he was the leader, and you can ask Marco because they've been debating this every debate that we've had.",
	"As far as coming back in, number one, you wouldn't even be talking, and you wouldn't have asked that as the first question if it weren't for me when my opening when I talked about illegals immigration.",
	"It wouldn't even be a big subject.",
	"But, we either have a country, or we don't have a country.",
	"We have at least 11 million people in this country that came in illegally.",
	"They will go out.",
	"They will come back -- some will come back, the best, through a process.",
	"They have to come back legally.",
	"They have to come back through a process, and it may not be a very quick process, but I think that's very fair, and very fine.",
	"They're going to get in line with other people.",
	"The best of them will come back, but they're going to come back through a process.",
	"Trump, do you want to respond to that? TRUMP: Well, I'm very glad that Ted mentioned Arizona because probably the toughest man on borders is Sheriff Joe Arpaio, and two days ago he totally endorsed me, so, thank you.",
	"Well, first of all, self-deportation is people are going to leave as soon as they see others going out.",
	"If you look at Dwight Eisenhower in the 1950s, they started moving people out and the rest of them left.",
	"Self-deportation, as I really define it, and that's the way I define it, is you're going to get some to go, and the rest are going to go out.",
	"As far as the people that I've hired in various parts of Florida during the absolute prime season, like Palm Beach and other locations, you could not get help.",
	"It's the up season.",
	"People didn't want to have part-time jobs.",
	"There were part-time jobs, very seasonal, 90-day jobs, 120-day jobs, and you couldn't get.",
	"Everybody agrees with me on that.",
	"They were part-time jobs.",
	"You needed them, or we just might as well close the doors, because you couldn't get help in those hot, hot sections of Florida.",
	"I criticized Mitt Romney for losing the election.",
	"He should have won that election.",
	"He had a failed president.",
	"He ran a terrible campaign.",
	"He was a terrible candidate.",
	"That's what I criticize Mitt Romney -- I mean, ran",
	"He ran one terrible campaign.",
	"That's an election that should have been won.",
	"No, no, I'm the only one on the stage that's hired people.",
	"You haven't hired anybody.",
	"And by the way, I've hired -- and by the way, I've hired tens of thousands of people over at my job.",
	"You've had nothing but problems with your credit cards, et cetera.",
	"So don't tell me about that.",
	"You haven't hired one person, you liar.",
	"I've hired tens of thousands of people over my lifetime.",
	"I've hired tens of thousands of people.",
	"He brings up something from 30 years ago, it worked out very well.",
	"And by the way, the laws were totally different.",
	"That was a whole different world.",
	"But I've hired people.",
	"Nobody up here has hired anybody.",
	"I can only say this, and I've said it loud and clear and I've said it for years.",
	"And many of these people are sitting right in the audience right now -- your lobbyist and your special interest and your donors, because the audience is packed with them, and they're packed with you.",
	"I've had an amazing relationship with politicians -- with politicians both Democrat, Republican, because I was a businessman.",
	"As one magazine said, he's a world-class businessman; he was friendly with everybody.",
	"I got along with everybody.",
	"You get along with nobody.",
	"You don't have one Republican -- you don't have one Republican senator, and you work with them every day of your life, although you skipped a lot of time.",
	"These are minor details.",
	"But you don't have one Republican senator backing you; not one.",
	"You don't have the endorsement of one Republican senator and you work with these people.",
	"You should be ashamed of yourself.",
	"Here's a man -- Robin Hood.",
	"This is Robin Hood over here.",
	"He talks about corruption.",
	"On his financial disclosure form, he didn't even put that he's borrowed money from Citibank and from Goldman Sachs, which is a total violation.",
	"He didn't talk about the fact that he pays almost no interest.",
	"He just left it off, and now he's going to protect the people from the big bad banks.",
	"Give me a break.",
	"I will, and the wall just got 10 feet taller, believe me.",
	"It just got 10 feet taller.",
	"I saw him make that -- I saw him make the statement.",
	"I saw him use the word that he used.",
	"I can only tell you, if I would have used even half of that word, it would have been national scandal.",
	"This guy used a filthy, disgusting word on television, and he should be ashamed of himself, and he should apologize, OK? Number one.",
	"Number two, we have a trade deficit with Mexico of $58 billion a year.",
	"And that doesn't include all the drugs that are pouring across and destroying our country.",
	"We're going to make them pay for that wall.",
	"Now, the wall is $10 billion to $12 billion, if I do it.",
	"If these guys do it, it'll end up costing $200 billion.",
	"But the wall is $10 billion to $12 billion.",
	"You need 1,000 -- you need 1,000 miles.",
	"The Great Wall of China, built 2,000 years ago -- 2,000, is 13,000 miles.",
	"We need 1,000, because we have a lot of natural barriers.",
	"We can do it for $10 billion to $12 billion, and it's a real wall.",
	"This is a wall that's a heck of a lot higher than the ceiling you're looking at.",
	"This is a wall that's going to work.",
	"Mexico will pay for it, because they are not doing us any favors.",
	"They could stop all of this illegal trade if they wanted to",
	"Mexico will pay for the wall.",
	"It's a small portion of the kind of money that we lose and the deficits that we have with Mexico.",
	"Well, you know, I don't mind trade wars when we're losing $58 billion a year, you want to know the truth.",
	"We're losing so much.",
	"We're losing so much with Mexico and China -- with China, we're losing $500 billion a year.",
	"And then people say, ",
	"don't we want to trade?",
	" I don't mind trading, but I don't want to lose $500 billion.",
	"I don't want to lose $58 billion.",
	"Mexico just took Carrier Corporation, maker of air conditioners.",
	"They just took Ford.",
	"They're building a $2.5 billion plant.",
	"They just took Nabisco out of Chicago.",
	"And I always say I'm not having Oreos anymore, which is true, by the way.",
	"But they just took a big plant from Nabisco into Mexico.",
	"They're taking our businesses.",
	"Such a cute sound bite.",
	"All right, you know what?",
	"Because they devalue their currency -- they devalue their currencies",
	"that makes it -- well, you don't know a thing about business.",
	"You lose on everything",
	"Let me just tell you -- they de-value their currency.",
	"They de-value their currencies.",
	"That makes it -- well, you don't know a thing about business.",
	"You lose on everything you do.",
	"Let me just tell you, they de-value their currencies.",
	"Japan with the cars.",
	"They de-value their currencies to such an extent that our businesses cannot compete with them, our workers lose their jobs",
	"But you wouldn't know anything about it because you're a lousy businessman.",
	"No, I -- and you know why? You know why?",
	"first of all, that's called a",
	"And by the way -- and by the way",
	"and by the way",
	"I've won most of the lawsuits.",
	"And they actually did a very good job, but I've won most of the lawsuits.",
	"Hey Wolf, let me ask you.",
	"Am I allowed to respond to this?",
	"Well let -- no, I haven't.",
	"Here's a guy -- here's a guy that buys a house for $179,000, he sells it to a lobbyist who's probably here for $380,000 and then legislation is passed.",
	"You tell me about this guy.",
	"This is what we're going to have as president.",
	"I borrowed $1 million",
	"I borrowed $1 million, I turned it into $10 billion",
	"more than $10 billion.",
	"I have to say, he lied this time.",
	"First of all, I don't believe anything Telemundo says.",
	"Number two, I currently employ thousands of Hispanics, and over the years, I've employed tens of thousands of Hispanics.",
	"They know, and the reason I won in Nevada, not only won the big one, but I also won subs, like, as an example, I won with women.",
	"I won with every single category.",
	"I won with men, I won with high-income, low-income, I won with Hispanics.",
	"And I got 46 percent.",
	"Nobody else was close.",
	"Because they know I'm going to bring jobs back from China, from Japan, from so many other places.",
	"And I've won many of the polls with Hispanics.",
	"I didn't maybe win the Telemundo poll.",
	"But one thing I'm also going to do, I'm going to be getting -- bringing a lot of people in who are Democrats, who are independents, and you're seeing that with the polls, because if you look at anywhere, look at any of the elections, every single election, it has been record-setting.",
	"And the good news is, for the Republican Party, the Democrats are getting very poor numbers in terms of bringing them in.",
	"We're getting record-setting numbers.",
	"I think I have something to do with that.",
	"We're getting record-setting numbers.",
	"And I won every one -- the three of them that I won, I won with record-setting numbers.",
	"New people are coming into the Republican Party.",
	"We are building a new Republican Party, a lot of new people are coming in.",
	"Do you know what? They're fine.",
	"Why did they take the poll? Why did they",
	"I'm just telling you, I'm doing very well with Hispanics.",
	"And by the way, I settled my suit, as you know, with Univision.",
	"We're good friends now.",
	"It was all settled up.",
	"Very happy, very happy.",
	"I'm just telling you -- I'm just telling you that I will do really well with Hispanics.",
	"I will do better than anybody on this stage.",
	"I have respect for the people on the stage, but I will do very well with Hispanics.",
	"But I'm telling you also, I'm bringing people, Democrats over and I'm bringing independents over, and we're building a much bigger, much stronger Republican Party.",
	"And I've been there.",
	"And I've been there very strongly.",
	"I do have to say something, and this is interesting and it's not anybody's fault.",
	"It's not Ted's fault.",
	"Justice Roberts was strongly recommended and pushed by Ted.",
	"Justice Roberts gave us Obamacare.",
	"Might as well be called Roberts-care.",
	"Two times of the Supreme Court, Justice Roberts approved something that he should have never raised his hand to approve.",
	"And we ended up with Obamacare.",
	"That is a rough thing.",
	"And I know Ted feels badly about it.",
	"And I think he probably still respects the judge.",
	"But that judge has been a disaster in terms of everything we stand for because there is no way -- no way that he should have approved Obamacare.",
	"Now, with that being said, these are the things that happen.",
	"But Ted very, very strongly pushed Judge Roberts, and Justice Roberts gave us something that we don't want.",
	"Well, let -- let me -- let me just say -- let me just say this.",
	"Look, I watched Ted -- and I respected it, but he gets nowhere -- stand on the Senate floor for a day or two days, and talk and talk and talk.",
	"I watched the other senators laughing and smiling.",
	"And when Ted was totally exhausted, he left the Senate floor, and they went back to work.",
	"OK? We have to have somebody that's going to make deals.",
	"It's wonderful to stand up for two days and do that.",
	"Now, Ted's been very critical -- I have a sister who's a brilliant",
	"She's a brilliant judge.",
	"He's been criticizing -- he's been criticizing my sister for signing a certain bill.",
	"You know who else signed that bill? Justice Samuel Alito, a very conservative member of the Supreme Court, with my sister, signed that bill.",
	"So I think that maybe we should get a little bit of an apology from Ted.",
	"What do you think?",
	"When you say crazy zealot, are you talking about you? Crazy zealot -- give me a break.",
	"Well, let -- let me just say -- let me just say, first of all, I have great respect for Justice Scalia.",
	"I thought he was terrific.",
	"And if you talk about evolving, Ronald Reagan was a somewhat liberal Democrat.",
	"Ronald Reagan evolved into a somewhat strong conservative -- more importantly, he was a great president.",
	"As far as Planned Parenthood is concerned, I'm pro-life.",
	"I'm totally against abortion, having to do with Planned Parenthood.",
	"But millions and millions of women -- cervical cancer, breast cancer -- are helped by Planned Parenthood.",
	"So you can say whatever you want, but they have millions of women going through Planned Parenthood that are helped greatly.",
	"And I wouldn't fund it.",
	"I would defund it because of the abortion factor, which they say is 3 percent.",
	"I don't know what percentage it is.",
	"They say it's 3 percent.",
	"But I would defund it, because I'm pro-life.",
	"But millions of women are helped by Planned Parenthood.",
	"I just want to say, I agree with that 100 percent, except pre-existing conditions, I would absolutely get rid of Obamacare.",
	"We're going to have something much better, but pre-existing conditions, when I'm referring to that, and I was referring to that very strongly on the show with Anderson Cooper, I want to keep pre- existing conditions.",
	"I think we need it.",
	"I think it's a modern age.",
	"And I think we have to have it.",
	"I think they're wrong 100 percent.",
	"What we need -- look, the insurance companies take care of the politicians.",
	"The insurance companies get what they want.",
	"We should have gotten rid of the lines around each state so we can have real competition.",
	"We thought that was gone, we thought those lines were going to be gone, so something happened at the last moment where Obamacare got approved, and all of that was thrown out the window.",
	"The reason is some of the people in the audience are insurance people, and insurance lobbyists, and special interests.",
	"They got -- I'm not going to point to these gentlemen, of course, they're part of the problem, other than Ben, in all fairness.",
	"And, actually, the Governor too, let's just talk about these too, OK?",
	"Because I don't think the Governor had too much to do with this.",
	"But, we should have gotten rid of the borders, we should have gotten rid of the lines around the state so there's great competition.",
	"The insurance companies are making a fortune on every single thing they do.",
	"I'm self-funding my campaign.",
	"I'm the only one in either party self-funding my campaign.",
	"I'm going to do what's right.",
	"We have to get rid of the lines around the states so that there's serious, serious competition.",
	"And, you're going to see -- excuse me.",
	"You're going to see preexisting conditions and everything else be part of it, but the price will be done, and the insurance companies can pay.",
	"Right now they're making a fortune.",
	"That's going to solve the problem.",
	"And, the insurance companies aren't going to say that, they want to keep it.",
	"They want to say -- they say whatever they have to say to keep it the way it is.",
	"I know the insurance companies, they're friends of mine.",
	"The top guys, they're friends of mine.",
	"I shouldn't tell you guys, you'll say it's terrible, I have a conflict of interest.",
	"They're friends of mine, there's some right in the audience.",
	"One of them was just waving to me, he was laughing and smiling.",
	"He's not laughing so much anymore.",
	"Look, the insurance companies are making an absolute fortune.",
	"Yes, they will keep preexisting conditions, and that would be a great thing.",
	"Get rid of Obamacare, we'll come up with new plans.",
	"But, we should keep preexisting conditions.",
	"And, you don't know what it means",
	"The biggest problem, I'll have you know",
	"You don't know much",
	"The lines around the states",
	"and, it was almost done -- not now",
	"You get rid of the lines, it brings in competition.",
	"So, instead of having one insurance company taking care of New York, or Texas, you'll have many.",
	"They'll compete, and it'll be a beautiful thing.",
	"The nice part of the plan -- you'll have many different plans.",
	"You'll have competition, you'll have so many different plans.",
	"I watched him repeat himself five times four weeks ago",
	"I just watched you repeat yourself five times five seconds ago",
	"I watched him meltdown on the stage like that, I've never seen it in anybody",
	"I thought he came out of the swimming pool",
	"We're going to have many different plans because",
	"There is going to be competition among all of the states, and the insurance companies.",
	"They're going to have many, many different plans.",
	" Is there anything else you would like to add to that",
	"No, there's nothing to add.",
	"What is to add?",
	"I do not want socialized medicine, just so you understand.",
	"He goes around saying oh, he wants it.",
	"I do not want socialized medicine.",
	"I do agree with him that it's going to be a disaster, Obamacare, for the economy.",
	"In 2017, it will be impossible for us to pay for it if you look at what's going on.",
	"That's why it has to be repealed, for a lot of reasons, Number one, it doesn't work, number two, premium.",
	"You look at premiums going up, 25, 35, even 45 percent, and more.",
	"We have to get rid of Obamacare.",
	"It is going to destroy our economy completely.",
	"Our economy is not doing well.",
	"It is going to destroy our economy greatly.",
	"And on that, I agree.",
	"No, I said it worked in a couple of countries",
	"No, I did not.",
	"No I did not.",
	"I will not let people die on the streets if I'm president.",
	"If people -- my plan is very simple.",
	"I will not -- we're going to have private -- we are going to have health care, but I will not allow people to die on the sidewalks and the streets of our country if I'm president.",
	"You may let it and you may be fine with it",
	"I'm not fine with it.",
	"We are going to take those people",
	"We are going to take those people and those people are going to be serviced by doctors and hospitals.",
	"We're going to make great deals on it, but we're not going to let them die in the streets.",
	"You know what? Call it what you want.",
	"Call it what you want, people are not going to be dying on the sidewalk.",
	"Because the country will become a dynamic economy.",
	"We'll be dynamic again.",
	"If you look at what's going on, we have the highest taxes anywhere in the world.",
	"We pay more business tax, we pay more personal tax.",
	"We have the highest taxes in the world.",
	"It's shutting off our economy.",
	"It's shutting off our country.",
	"We have trillions of dollars outside that we can't get in.",
	"Yes, we will do my tax plan, and it will be great.",
	"We will have a dynamic economy again.",
	"We're going to make many cuts in business.",
	"We're getting rid of -- we're going to get rid of so many different things.",
	"Department of Education -- Common Core is out.",
	"Have to go local.",
	"Environmental protection -- we waste all of this money.",
	"We're going to bring that back to the states.",
	"And we're going to have other ",
	"We are going to cut many of the agencies, we will balance our budget, and we will be dynamic again.",
	"Waste, fraud and abuse all over the place.",
	"Waste, fraud and abuse.",
	"You look at what's happening with Social Security, you look -- look at what's happening with every agency -- waste, fraud and abuse.",
	"We will cut so much, your head will spin.",
	"I just want to say -- and I'm a big fan of the governor, but they also struck oil, OK, so that helped Iowa a lot.",
	"First of all, let me just explain.",
	"I was the first one to file a financial disclosure form -- almost 100 pages.",
	"You don't learn anything about somebody's wealth with a tax return.",
	"You learn it from statements.",
	"I filed -- which shows that I'm worth over $10 billion.",
	"I built a great company with very little debt.",
	"People were shocked, the people in the back, the reporters, they were shocked when they went down.",
	"And I filed it on time.",
	"I didn't ask for five 45-day extensions, which I would have been entitled to.",
	"So as far as that's concerned, I filed it.",
	"And that's where you find out what kind of a company.",
	"You don't learn anything from a tax return.",
	"I will say this.",
	"Mitt Romney looked like a fool when he delayed and delayed and delayed.",
	"And Harry Reid baited him so beautifully.",
	"And Mitt Romney didn't file his return until a September 21st of 2012, about a month-and-a-half before the election.",
	"And it cost him big league.",
	"As far as my return, I want to file it, except for many years, I've been audited every year.",
	"Twelve years, or something like that.",
	"Every year they audit me, audit me, audit me.",
	"Nobody gets audited -- I have friends that are very wealthy people.",
	"They never get audited.",
	"I get audited every year.",
	"I will absolutely give my return, but I'm being audited now for two or three years, so I can't do it until the audit is finished, obviously.",
	"And I think people would understand that.",
	"Are you going to ask anybody else that question?",
	"Every single question comes to me?",
	"I know I'm here for the ratings, but it's a little bit ridiculous.",
	"First of all, very few people listen to your radio show.",
	"That's the good news.",
	"Let me just tell you, let me just -- which happens to be true.",
	"Check out the ratings.",
	"Look, let me just tell you something.",
	"Let me just tell you something.",
	"I want to release my tax returns but I can't release it while I'm under an audit.",
	"We're under a routine audit.",
	"I've had it for years, I get audited.",
	"And obviously if I'm being audited, I'm not going to release a return.",
	"As soon as the audit is done, I love it.",
	"Eighty-five percent say you, big difference.",
	"So at the beginning, I said openly to everybody that I contribute to many, many politicians, both Republican and Democrat.",
	"And I have, over the years.",
	"I have, over the years.",
	"And I sort of have to laugh when Ted makes a big deal out of the fact that he's doing well in the polls.",
	"Well, I'm beating him in virtually every poll.",
	"I'm tied in Texas, by the way, which I shouldn't be.",
	"But I think I'll do very well.",
	"But a poll just came out -- a Bloomberg poll -- where I am beating him so badly that it's, like, embarrassing even for me to say I'm beating him that badly.",
	"And -- and here's the thing -- it was sort of funny -- 65 percent of the people don't like you -- I just got 36 percent of the vote, right? I just got 46 percent on another one.",
	"I got 38 percent",
	"That means -- and he got 20 and 22, and he lost in South Carolina so badly -- that was going to be his stronghold.",
	"He said a year ago, I can't lose South Carolina.",
	" I beat him in a landslide.",
	"Last week in Nevada, I beat him in a landslide, and he sang (ph) about the polls.",
	"One other thing -- Hillary Clinton -- take a look at USA Today, take a look at the Q poll.",
	"I beat her, and I beat her badly.",
	"And I -- and I haven't even started at her.",
	"I only had one little interchange",
	"I only had one little interchange, and that was",
	"four weeks ago, when she said I was sexist.",
	"And believe me, they had a rough weekend that weekend, between Bill and Hillary.",
	"They had a rough weekend.",
	"You -- you don't",
	"first of all, he's talking about the polls.",
	"I'm beating him awfully badly in the polls.",
	"Well, then, if I can't -- if -- hey, if I can't beat her, you're really going to get killed, aren't you?",
	"I'm being audited 12 years in a row, at least.",
	"Now, until that audit's done, and I don't think anybody would blame me, I'm not giving it",
	" audited for those years.",
	"Well, first of all, I don't think they do under President Obama because I think he's treated Israel horribly, all right? I think he's treated Israel horribly.",
	"I was the grand marshall down 5th Avenue a number of years ago for the Israeli Day Parade, I have very close ties to Israel.",
	"I've received the Tree of Life Award and many of the greatest awards given by Israel.",
	"As president, however, there's nothing that I would rather do to bring peace to Israel and its neighbors generally.",
	"And I think it serves no purpose to say that you have a good guy and a bad guy.",
	"Now, I may not be successful in doing it.",
	"It's probably the toughest negotiation anywhere in the world of any kind.",
	"OK? But it doesn't help if I start saying, ",
	"I am very pro-Israel, very pro, more than anybody on this stage.",
	" But it doesn't do any good to start demeaning the neighbors, because I would love to do something with regard to negotiating peace, finally, for Israel and for their neighbors.",
	"And I can't do that as well -- as a negotiator, I cannot do that as well if I'm taking big, big sides.",
	"With that being said, I am totally pro-Israel.",
	"Well, I can only say -- look, I can only say I've been a big contributor to Israel over the years.",
	"I've received many, many awards from Israel, as I've said before.",
	"I have a great relationship with Israel.",
	"And I'm going to keep it that way.",
	"And if I could bring peace, that would be a fantastic thing.",
	"It would be one of my greatest achievements as president.",
	"I've done very well over the years through negotiation.",
	"It's very important that we do that.",
	"In all fairness, Marco is not a negotiator.",
	"I watched him melt down and I'll tell you, it was one of the saddest things I've ever seen.",
	"He's not going down -- excuse me",
	"wait a minute, and these people may even be tougher than Chris Christie.",
	"OK, no, no, no -- a deal is a deal.",
	"Let me tell you that.",
	"I learned a long time ago.",
	"You are not a negotiator.",
	"You are not a negotiator.",
	"And, with your thinking, you will never bring peace.",
	"You will never bring peace",
	"Excuse me, I want to be able to bring peace",
	"He will never be able to do it.",
	"I think I may be able to do it, although I will say this.",
	"Probably the toughest deal of any kind is that particular deal.",
	"One thing I'd like to add to what the Governor's saying, I think that we are now in a position -- are $19 trillion dollars because of the horrible omnibus budget that was approved six weeks ago, it's going to be $21 trillion dollars.",
	"We can no longer defend all of these countries, Japan, Germany, South Korea.",
	"You order televisions, you order almost anything, you're getting it from these countries.",
	"Whether it's a Mercedes-Benz, or whether it's an air conditioning unit.",
	"They're coming out of these countries.",
	"They are making a fortune.",
	"Saudi Arabia, we are defending Saudi Arabia.",
	"Before the oil went down, now they're making less, but they're making plenty.",
	"They were making $1 billion dollars a day.",
	"We defend all of these countries for peanuts.",
	"You talk about budgets.",
	"We have to start getting reimbursed for taking care of the military services for all of these countries.",
	"I really don't because it not working and the countries aren't agreeing to it and the rebels aren't agreeing and Syria is not agreeing.",
	"So It's a meaningless ceasefire.",
	"I love the idea of a ceasefire.",
	"I love the idea of -- with a total cessation.",
	"But it's not working, as you know very well.",
	"If -- we can do what we want with Russia but nobody else is adhering to it.",
	"So I certainly support it, I would certainly love it, but all parties have to be part of it.",
	"Again, I think I gave them both checks to be exactly honest.",
	"I think they both liked me very much.",
	"But the fact is that ",
	"Well, I think Bush did a hell of a bad as far as that's concerned.",
	"You know it and so do I.",
	"No, this was before.",
	"The check came early.",
	"But let me just tell you, Syria, he's saying that I was in favor of Syria.",
	"He said I was in favor of Libya? I never discussed that subject.",
	"I was in favor of Libya? We would be so much better off if Gadhafi were in charge right now.",
	"If these politicians went to the beach and didn't do a thing, and we had Saddam Hussein and if we had Gadhafi in charge, instead of having terrorism all over the place, we'd be -- at least they killed terrorists, all right?",
	"And I'm not saying they were good because they were bad, they were really bad, but we don't know what we're getting.",
	"You look at Libya right now, ISIS, as we speak, is taking over their oil.",
	"As we speak, it's a total mess.",
	"We would have been better off if the politicians took a day off instead of going into war.",
	"I never said walk away.",
	"I wouldn't want to walk away.",
	"I want them to pay us much more money.",
	"We cannot afford to subsidize",
	"I'll negotiate a lot more money than you'll ever get.",
	"As far as John Kerry is concerned, there has been no tougher critic of this man, I think he negotiated one of the worst deals in the history of our country, the Iran deal, where they get their $150 billion and all of the other things that take place.",
	"It is a disaster for this country, and speaking of Israel, it's a disaster for Israel.",
	"I'm no fan of John Kerry.",
	"Well, look, my response is very simple.",
	"There is nobody on this stage that has done more for Israel than I have.",
	"You might say, you might talk, you're politicians, all talk, no action.",
	"I've been watching it all my life.",
	"You are all talk and no action.",
	"What I've seen up here -- I mean, first of all, this guy is a choke artist, and this guy is a liar.",
	"You have a combination",
	"You have a combination of factors.",
	"He can't do it",
	"for the obvious reason, and he can't do it because he doesn't know how to tell the truth.",
	"Other than that, I rest my case.",
	"I watched -- I watched",
	"I watched what this man did to Dr.",
	"Ben Carson, who I respect, in Iowa, where he said that Ben Carson is out of the race -- he has left Iowa and he's out of the race.",
	"And I thought it was disgraceful.",
	"And got a lot of votes because of that -- a lot of votes.",
	"Took them away from Ben Carson.",
	"Probably took them away from me, too.",
	"But I watched it.",
	"I also watched where he did a forum that looked like it came right out of a government agency, and it said on top, ",
	" and then it graded you",
	"and it scared the hell out of people, and it said the only way you clear up the violation, essentially, is to go and vote for Ted Cruz.",
	"I watched that fraudulent document, and I said it's the worst thing I've ever seen in politics.",
	"To me, that was even worse than what he did to Ben.",
	"I know politicians -- I know politicians, believe it or not, better than you do.",
	"And it's not good.",
	"Can you believe it?",
	"I funded this guy.",
	"I gave him a check.",
	"I gave him a check.",
	"He never funded me.",
	"You know why? I didn't want to, but he sent me his book with his autograph",
	"Trump, you're doing a great job.",
	"I have his book.",
	"Thank you -- thank you for the book.",
	"This is a lot of fun up here tonight, I have to tell you.",
	"Thank -- thank you for the book.",
	"I really appreciate (ph).",
	"You're the basket case.",
	"You're losing so badly you -- I want to",
	"I -- you don't know what's happening.",
	"Traceback (most recent call last):",
	"First of all, you're talking about a border that's many, many times longer.",
	"You're talking about a massive border.",
	"We have far less problem with that border than we do with our Southern border, and tremendous amounts -- you know, I won, I had the privilege of winning by a landslide, by the way, New Hampshire.",
	"You go to New Hampshire, the first thing they talk about is heroin and drugs pouring in.",
	"And, you wouldn't think this beautiful place -- it's beautiful.",
	"With the trees and the roads, and the countryside.",
	"Their biggest problem is heroin, and it's such a shame to see it.",
	"They're pouring in from the Southern border, so I'm talking about great security.",
	"I'm talking about a wall that can absolutely be built, and I'll build it on time, on budget.",
	"It'll be a very high wall, a great wall.",
	"It's going to be built, it's going to be built.",
	"It's going to be paid for by Canada, by the way -- maybe I'll get Canada to pay? Got to be paid for by Mexico.",
	"The problem with Canada, you're talking about a massively long piece.",
	"You're talking about a border that would be about four times longer.",
	"It would be very, very hard to do, and we -- it is not our biggest problem.",
	"I don't care what anyone says.",
	"It is not our big problem.",
	"Our big problem is not only people coming in, and in many cases the wrong people, it's the tremendous amount of drugs that are coming in.",
	"Nobody knows politicians better than I do.",
	"They're all talk, they're no action, nothing gets done.",
	"I've watched it for years.",
	"Take a look at what's happening to our country.",
	"All of the things that I've been talking about, whether it's trade, whether it's building up our depleted military, whether it's taking care of our vets, whether it's getting rid of Common Core, which is a disaster, or knocking out Obamacare and coming up with something so much better, I will get it done.",
	"Politicians will never, ever get it done.",
	"And we will make America great again.",
	"Well, I can say this.",
	"If the President, and if I were President now I would certainly want to try and nominate a justice.",

	"These are terrible people in ISIS, not masterminds.",
	"And we have to change it from every standpoint.",
	"But we should be using our brilliant people, our most brilliant minds to figure a way that ISIS cannot use the Internet.",

	"They went home and they wanted to watch their boyfriends on television.",
	"I would be very, very firm with families.",

	"We need a toughness.",
	"We're not respected, you know, as a nation anymore.",

	"And if we don't get it back fast, we're just going to go weaker, weaker and just disintegrate.",
	"We can't allow that to happen.",
	"We don't have it.",
	"When Jeb comes out and he talks about the border, and I saw it and I was witness to it, and so was everyone else, and I was standing there, ",
	"they come across as an act of love,",
	" he's saying the same thing right now with radical Islam.",
	"And we can't have that in our country.",
	"It just won't work.",
	"With Jeb's attitude, we will never be great again, that I can tell you.",
	"We will never be great again.",
	"So, they can kill us, but we can't kill them? That's what you're saying.",
	"And as far as the Internet is concerned, we're not talking about closing the Internet.",
	"I'm talking about parts of Syria, parts of Iraq, where ISIS is, spotting it.",
	"Now, you could close it.",
	"What I like even better than that is getting our smartest and getting our best to infiltrate their Internet, so that we know exactly where they're going, exactly where they're going to be.",
	"I like that better.",
	"But we have to -- who would be -- I just can't imagine somebody booing.",

	"I don't think so.",
	"Everybody standby for a moment.",
	"Governor Kasich, go ahead.",
	"In my opinion, we've spent $4 trillion trying to topple various people that frankly, if they were there and if we could've spent that $4 trillion in the United States to fix our roads, our bridges, and all of the other problems; our airports and all of the other problems we've had, we would've been a lot better off.",
	"I can tell you that right now.",
	"We have done a tremendous disservice, not only to Middle East, we've done a tremendous disservice to humanity.",
	"The people that have been killed, the people that have wiped away, and for what? It's not like we had victory.",
	"The Middle East is totally destabilized.",
	"A total and complete mess.",
	"I wish we had the $4 trillion or $5 trillion.",
	"I wish it were spent right here in the United States, on our schools, hospitals, roads, airports, and everything else that are all falling apart.",
	"Well, there's nothing to respond to.",
	"Well, people feel differently.",
	"I mean, the fact is Benghazi was a disaster because of Libya, everything just fell into place.",

	"And Iran is fighting ISIS.",
	"We have to do one thing at a time.",
	"We can't go -- and I watched Lindsey Graham, he said, I have been here for 10 years fighting.",
	"Well, he will be there with that thinking for another 50 years.",
	"He won't be able to solve the problem.",
	"We have to get rid of ISIS first.",
	"After we get rid of ISIS, we'll start thinking about it.",

	"So, so far, I'm doing better.",
	"So far, I'm doing better.",
	"You know, you started off over here, Jeb.",
	"You're moving over further and further.",
	"Pretty soon you're going to be off the end",
	"I have a very hardline position, we have a country or we don't have a country.",
	"People that have come into our country illegally, they have to go.",
	"They have to come back into through a legal process.",
	"I want a strong border.",
	"I do want a wall.",
	"Walls do work, you just have to speak to the folks in Israel.",
	"Walls work if they're properly constructed.",
	"I know how to build, believe me, I know how to build.",
	"I feel a very, very strong bind, and really I'm bound to this country, we either have a border or we don't.",
	"People can come into the country, we welcome people to come but they have to come in legally.",
	"Well, first of all, I think we need somebody absolutely that we can trust, who is totally responsible; who really knows what he or she is doing.",
	"That is so powerful and so important.",
	"And one of the things that I'm frankly most proud of is that in 2003, 2004, I was totally against going into Iraq because you're going to destabilize the Middle East.",
	"I called it very strongly.",
	"And it was very important.",
	"But we have to be extremely vigilant and extremely careful when it comes to nuclear.",
	"Nuclear changes the whole ball game.",
	"Frankly, I would have said get out of Syria; get out -- if we didn't have the power of weaponry today.",
	"The power is so massive that we can't just leave areas that 50 years ago or 75 years ago we wouldn't care.",
	"It was hand-to-hand combat.",
	"The biggest problem this world has today is not President Obama with global warming, which is inconceivable, this is what he's saying.",
	"The biggest problem we have is nuclear -- nuclear proliferation and having some maniac, having some madman go out and get a nuclear weapon.",
	"That's in my opinion, that is the single biggest problem that our country faces right now.",
	"I think -- I think, for me, nuclear is just the power, the devastation is very important to me.",
	"Let me just say that I have gotten to know him over the last three or four days.",
	"He has a wonderful temperament.",
	"Don't worry about it.",
	"You better not attack",
	"I'll be honest, I really am.",
	"I mean, the people have been putting me",
	"Can I just finish my",
	"I've gained great respect for the Republican leadership.",
	"I've gained great respect for many -- and I'm going to even say -- I mean, in different forms for the people on the dais, in different forms.",
	"But I have great respect for the people I have met through this process.",
	"I've never done this process before.",
	"I've never been a politician.",
	"I mean, for the last six months I've been a politician.",
	"But I will tell you, I am totally committed to the Republican Party.",
	"I feel very honored to be the front runner.",
	"Polls have come out recently saying I would beat Hillary.",
	"I will do everything in my power to beat Hillary Clinton, I promise you.",

	"I employ thousands and thousands of people.",
	"I've gotten along with people for years and years, have tremendous relationships with many people, including politicians on both sides.",
	"And no matter how you cut it, when I -- when I came out, I hit immigration, I hit it very hard.",
	" because I talked about illegal immigration.",
	"Now, everybody's coming to me, they're all trying to say, well, he's right, we have to come to him.",
	"I hit other things.",
	"I talked about Muslims.",
	"We have a problem.",
	"Nobody else wanted to mention the problem, I brought it up.",
	"I took a lot of heat.",
	"We have to have a temporary something, because there's something going on that's not good.",
	"And remember this, I'm the only one up here, when the war of Iraq -- in Iraq, I was the one that said, ",
	"Don't go, don't do it, you're going to destabilize the Middle East.",
	" So, I'm not one with a trigger.",
	"I'm not one with a trigger.",
	"Other people up here, believe me, would be a lot faster.",
	"But I'll build the mill arbitrary stronger, bigger, better than anybody up here, and nobody is going to mess with us.",
	"That, I can tell you.",
	"Am I allowed to respond? I have to respond.",
	"First of all, I respect what Ted just said, but if you noticed, he didn't answer your question.",
	"And that's what's going to happen -- OK.",
	"That's what's going to happen with our enemies and the people we compete against.",
	"We're going to win with Trump.",
	"We're going to win.",
	"We don't win anymore.",
	"Our country doesn't win anymore.",
	"We're going to win with Trump.",
	"And people back down with Trump.",
	"And that's what I like and that's what the country is going to like.",
	"Well, let me say a couple of things.",
	"First of all, Marco said earlier on that President Obama knows exactly what he's doing, like we have this president that really knows.",
	"I disagree, respectfully, with Marco.",
	"I think we have a president who, as a president, is totally incompetent, and he doesn't know what he's doing.",
	"I think he has no idea what he's doing.",
	"And our country is going to hell.",
	"So, I just want to say, we disagree on that.",
	"As to North Korea?",
	"We have -- tremendous -- has been just sucked out of our country by China.",
	"China says they don't have that good of control over North Korea.",
	"They have tremendous control.",
	"I deal with the Chinese all of the time.",
	"I do tremendous -- the largest bank in the world is in one of my buildings in Manhattan.",
	"I deal with them.",
	"They have total, absolute control, practically, of North Korea.",
	"They are sucking trillions of dollars out of our country -- they're rebuilding China with the money they take out of our country.",
	"I would get on with China, let China solve that problem.",
	"They can do it quickly and surgically.",
	"That's what we should do with North Korea.",
	"I don't think I am.",
	"I think I'm closer to common sense.",
	"We are going to repeal Obamacare.",
	"We're going to repeal Obamacare.",
	"We are going to replace Obamacare with something so much better.",
	"And there are so many examples of it.",
	"And I will tell you, part of the reason we have some people laughing, because you have insurance people that take care of everybody up here.",
	"The only one they're not taking care of is me.",
	"We have our lines around each state.",
	"The insurance companies are getting rich on Obamacare.",
	"The insurance companies are getting rich on health care and health services and everything having to do with health.",
	"We are going to end that.",
	"We're going to take out the artificial boundaries, the artificial lines.",
	"We're going to get a plan where people compete, free enterprise.",
	"In addition to that, you have the health care savings plans, which are excellent.",
	"What I do say is, there will be a certain number of people that will be on the street dying and as a Republican, I don't want that to happen.",
	"We're going to take care of people that are dying on the street because there will be a group of people that are not going to be able to even think in terms of private or anything else and we're going to take care of those people.",
	"And I think everybody on this stage would have to agree",
	"you're not going to let people die, sitting in the middle of a street in any city in this country.",
	"Well, let me just tell you about eminent domain because almost all of these people actually criticize it, but so many people have hit me with commercials and other things about eminent domain.",
	"Eminent domain is an absolute necessity for a country, for our country.",
	"Without it, you wouldn't have roads, you wouldn't have hospitals, you wouldn't have anything.",
	"You wouldn't have schools, you wouldn't have bridges.",
	"You need eminent domain.",
	"And a lot of the big conservatives that tell me how conservative they are -- I think I'm more than they are -- they tell me, oh -- well, they all want the Keystone Pipeline.",
	"The Keystone Pipeline, without eminent domain, it wouldn't go 10 feet, OK? You need eminent domain.",
	"And eminent domain is a good thing, not a bad thing.",
	"And what a lot of people don't know because they were all saying, oh, you're going to take their property.",
	"When somebody -- when eminent domain is used on somebody's property, that person gets a fortune.",
	"They get at least fair market value, and if they are smart, they'll get two or three times the value of their property.",
	"But without eminent domain, you don't have roads, highways, schools, bridges or anything.",
	"So eminent domain -- it's not that I love it, but eminent domain is absolutely -- it's a necessity for a country.",
	"And certainly it's a necessity for our country.",
	"Jeb wants to be -- he wants to be a tough guy tonight.",
	"I didn't take the property.",
	"I didn't take the property.",
	"The woman ultimately didn't want to do that.",
	"Well, let me just -- you know, he wants to be a tough guy.",
	"A lot of times, you'll have -- you'll have -- and it didn't work very well.",
	"A lot of time -- let me talk.",
	"A lot of times -- a lot of times",
	"you -- let me talk.",
	"A lot of times",
	"that's all of his donors and special interests out there.",
	"So -- it's what it is.",
	"That's what -- and by the way, let me just tell you, we needed tickets.",
	"You can't get them.",
	"You know who has the tickets for the -- I'm talking about, to the television audience? Donors, special interests, the people that are putting up the money.",
	"That's who it is.",
	"The RNC told us.",
	"We have all donors in the audience.",
	"And the reason they're not loving me",
	"the reason they're not -- excuse me.",
	"The reason they're not loving me is, I don't want their money.",
	"I'm going to do the right thing for the American public.",
	"I don't want their money.",
	"I don't need their money.",
	"And I'm the only one up here that can say that.",
	"Eminent domain, the Keystone pipeline -- do you consider that a private job? Do you -- do you consider that",
	"No -- no, let me ask you, Jeb.",
	"Do you consider the Keystone pipeline private?",
	"Is it public or private?",
	"No, it's a private job.",
	"It's a private job.",
	"You wouldn't have the Keystone pipeline that you want so badly without eminent domain.",
	"You wouldn't have massive -- excuse me, Josh -- you wouldn't have massive factories without eminent domain.",
	"Well, I think I am, and to me, I view the word conservative as a derivative I -- of -- of the word conserve.",
	"We want to converse our money.",
	"We want to conserve our wealth.",
	"We want to conserve.",
	"We want to be smart.",
	"We want to be smart where we go, where we spend, how we spend.",
	"We want to conserve our country.",
	"We want to save our country.",
	"And we have people that have no idea how to do that and they are not doing it, and it's a very important word and it's something I believe in very, very strongly.",
	"Well, four years ago, I said, bomb the oil and take the oil.",
	"And if we did that, they wouldn't have the wealth they have right now.",
	"Now, I still say the same thing, because we're doing little pinpricks.",
	"We're not even bombing -- if somebody's driving a truck, they give notice to the person driving the truck, ",
	"we're going to bomb.",
	"If they don't get out of the truck, the truck sails away with the oil.",
	"We actually have a case where we don't want to bomb the oil, because we don't want to hurt -- pollute the atmosphere.",
	"Can you imagine General Douglas MacArthur or General Patton saying we can't bomb because we're gonna hurt the atmosphere?",
	"You have to knock the hell out of the oil.",
	"You have to take the oil.",
	"And you have also back channels of banking.",
	"You have people that you think are our great allies, our friends, in the Middle East, that are paying tremendous numbers of -- tremendous amounts of money to ISIS.",
	"So we have to stop those circuits.",
	"Nobody knows banking better than I do.",
	"They have back circuits, back channels.",
	"Tremendous amounts of money is coming in through the banking system.",
	"So between the oil and the banking, you will dry them up.",
	"But it should have been done four years ago, not now.",
	"You have to go in -- first of all, when you take away their money, when you take away their wealth, that'll very much weaken -- and it will happen fairly fast.",
	"They'll last for about a year, based on all of the wealth they've accumulated.",
	"But when you stop the banking channels and when you stop the oil and take the oil -- not just bomb it, take it -- when you do that, it's going to dry up very quickly.",
	"They're going to become a very weakened power, quickly.",
	"Well, I'll tell you what.",
	"In the Middle East, we have people chopping the heads off Christians, we have people chopping the heads off many other people.",
	"We have things that we have never seen before -- as a group, we have never seen before, what's happening right now.",
	"The medieval times -- I mean, we studied medieval times -- not since medieval times have people seen what's going on.",
	"I would bring back waterboarding and I'd bring back a hell of a lot worse than waterboarding.",
	"No, a good deal maker will make great deals, but we'll do it the way our founders thought it should be done.",
	"People get together, they make deals.",
	"Ronald Reagan did it with Tip O'Neil very successfully, you didn't hear so much about executive orders, if you heard about it at all.",
	"You have to be able to get a consensus.",
	"Now, the real person like it was mentioned about the deal with Iran, how bad a deal is that? It doesn't get any more amateurish than that.",
	"A good deal maker would never make a deal like that.",
	"With Congress, you have to get everybody in a room, and you have to get them to agree.",
	"But, you have to get them to agree what you want, and that's part of being a deal maker.",
	"You can't leave the White House, go to Hawaii and play golf for three weeks and be a real deal maker.",
	"It doesn't work that way.",
	"You have to get people in, grab them, hug them, kiss them, and get the deal done.",
	"But, it's got to be the deal that you want.",
	"Some? KASICH: to get the balance the federal budget balanced? You have to plead with people.",
	"To do what we've done in Ohio, you have to plead with people, then you go back down to Washington and do the same thing.",
	"See, we have to remind people we're Americans before we're Republicans and Democrats, and when we wait, and when we delay what we end up doing, Mary Katharine, is we make the United States weaker.",
	"In fact, it's a foreign policy issue because people look at America not solving problems and they say what are they doing over there? The point is you have to work with people.",
	"The problem with executive authority for the president, it's really bad news for this reason.",
	"Since he's given up on working with Congress, he thinks he can impose anything he wants.",
	"He's not a king.",
	"An executive order should be used frankly in consolidation and with consulting with the leadership in the -- in the Congress.",
	"I've done it in Ohio.",
	"I could use executive orders, but I don't trump the legislature, because if you do, you aggravate them, you anger them and then the long-term prospects get bleak.",
	"We have to solve problems in America by coming together, Republicans and Democrats, Americans first, party and ideology second -- in the second back seat of this country.",
	"That's what we need to do.",
	"And we can do it.",
	"And we can do it.",
	"It looked like he was looking right at me, right there.",
	"I think that -- I look at what's going on, I look at all of the polls, I do very, very well against Hillary Clinton.",
	"I can tell you, I'm the last person that she wants to run against.",
	"And I think you can see what we've done in terms of galvanizing.",
	"I've been all over the country.",
	"We're -- last night, I was in South Carolina, we had 12,000 people.",
	"It set up in about four days.",
	"We have galvanized and we've created a movement.",
	"A lot of it has to do with -- as an example, Josh's question on drugs.",
	"I'm the first person that said, ",
	" But I mean, a real wall, not a toy wall like they have right now.",
	"And you'll solve lots of problems.",
	"But we will galvanize the people of this country, and we will beat Hillary Clinton.",
	"Because -- assuming that she runs, by the way, how she gets away with the e-mail stuff is hard to believe.",
	"So, I don't know that she's going to be running.",
	"But on the assumption she runs",
	"And speaking of that, if she runs, she's running for one reason.",
	"She's going to be able to run for one reason, and that's because the Democrats are protecting her.",
	"Because so many people have done so much less than her, and they were absolutely -- their lives have been destroyed.",
	"But on the assumption they do protect her, I will win the election and we will win it by a lot.",
	"We will win it handily.",
	"We cannot have another four years of essentially Barack Obama.",
	"Well, there is a divide, but I have to say that the police are absolutely mistreated and misunderstood, and if there is an incident, whether it's an incident done purposely -- which is a horror, and you should really take very strong action -- or if it is a mistake, it's on your news casts all night, all week, all month, and it never ends.",
	"The police in this country have done an unbelievable job of keeping law and order, and they're afraid for their jobs, they're afraid of the mistreatment they get, and I'm telling you that not only, me speaking, minorities all over the country, they respect the police of this country and we have to give them more respect.",
	"They're afraid for losing their pension, their job.",
	"They don't know what to do.",
	"And I deal with them all the time.",
	"We have to give great respect, far greater than we are right now, to our really fantastic police.",
	"And, you know, they sue.",
	"Everybody sues, right? They see excessive -- I mean, they go out, they sue.",
	"We have so much litigation -- I see the courts, I see what they're doing.",
	"They sue, and you know what? We don't want excessive force.",
	"But at what point -- you know, either you're going to have a police force that can do its job",
	"I was just up in Manchester, I met with the police officers yesterday.",
	"They love the area, they love the people, they love all the people.",
	"They want to do their job.",
	"And you're going to have abuse and you're going to have problems, and you've got to solve the problems and you have to weed out the problems.",
	"But the police in this country are absolutely amazing people.",
	"I will tell you that I think nobody here, nobody on this stage, gets along with the veterans groups in New Hampshire better than I do without ball (ph) to sarel (ph) and all of the people that I deal with and these are great people.",
	"The one thing that we're not mentioning, there's tremendous fraud, waste and abuse in the Veterans Administration and if I'm running things, that's going to disappear",
	"and it's going to disappear quickly.",
	"That's because he got Ben Carson's votes, by the way, but we won't ",
	"Our country that we love so much doesn't win anymore.",
	"We don't win with the military, we don't' win on the border.",
	"You look at New Hampshire with the tremendous problem we have with heroin.",
	"Number one thing I hear from the people of New Hampshire, who I love, and developed such relationships, we don't win with healthcare.",
	"We don't win with trade.",
	"You look at what other countries are doing to us.",
	"Everyone, they're killing us on trade.",
	"If I'm elected president, we will win, and we will win, and we will win.",
	"Thank you, thank you very much.",
	"Thank you very much, everybody.",
	"Well, I want to begin by thanking the people of South Carolina.",
	"This is a special state.",
	"These are special people and we got a little boost last week from a place we all remember -- New Hampshire.",
	"We can't forget it.",
	"And they sent us in here with a very good feeling, right?",
	"So I really want to thank you and my volunteers.",
	"All of these people -- volunteers and they travel and they -- and I say, ",
	"what are you doing?",
	" And now they're going to Texas and they're going all over.",
	"Some are going to Nevada.",
	"I'll be going to Nevada.",
	"We're making a big speech tomorrow in Atlanta and then we're going right to Nevada.",
	"And I think we're going to do terrific and the SEC's (ph) going to be very, very exciting.",
	"We expect to do very, very well.",
	"I want to just say thank you to my family.",
	"It's been not easy for them.",
	"They don't see me anymore.",
	"I'm making speeches all the time and I have a great.",
	"I really have a great family so I just want to thank all of you.",
	"And Ivanka -- you know we have a hospital ready just in case.",
	"In South Carolina we're going to have a baby.",
	"There's nothing wrong with that, right? So ",
	"Could be -- it could be any second.",
	"It could even be before I'm finished but it's -- but she insisted on being here.",
	"It was so important to Ivanka to insist on being here so thank you.",
	"Really good and Jared, Vanessa, Don.",
	"We have a wonderful lieutenant governor who backed us very early in the process.",
	"You know Henry, right? The lieutenant governor of South Carolina.",
	"I will take him over the governor anytime because we won.",
	"He handle that very nicely.",
	"Tiffany, Eric, Lara and Melania.",
	"TRUMP: Just want to say an amazing place -- South Carolina.",
	"Congratulation to my husband.",
	"He was working very hard and he loves you.",
	"We love you and we're going ahead to Nevada.",
	"And we will see what happen (sic).",
	"He would be the best president ",
	"And representing some very, very wonderful children, Ivanka.",
	"Just say a few words.",
	"TRUMP: Thank you, South Carolina.",
	"This is an amazing, amazing night.",
	"The momentum since the beginning of this campaign has been unbelievable and that's because my father's message resonants so deeply with so many people.",
	"So as our family we're incredibly proud.",
	"We're incredibly grateful to each of you so thank you for being here to support us.",
	"And I will say this, my father is an incredibly hard worker and he'll be working for each and every one of you.",
	"So together we'll make America great again.",
	"Thank you very much.",
	"Thank you very much.",
	"So I was watching upstairs and it was really amazing to be watching what I was watching.",
	"And some of the pundits and overall fair but not too much.",
	"But a number of the pundits said, ",
	"well, if a couple of the other candidates dropped out if you add their scores together it's going to equal Trump.",
	"But these geniuses -- they're geniuses -- they don't understand that as people drop out I'm going to get a lot of those votes also.",
	"You don't just add them together.",
	"So I think we're going to do very, very well.",
	"I think we're going to do very well.",
	"I want to also congratulate the other candidates.",
	"In particular I have to say Ted and Marco did a really good job and they got -- they did quite well as I understand.",
	"One second, right? Good.",
	"We go back to war tomorrow morning.",
	"Tomorrow morning we'll be back but I just want to congratulate the other candidates.",
	"There's nothing easy about running for president, I can tell you.",
	"It's tough, it's nasty, it's mean, it's vicious, it's beautiful.",
	"When you win it's beautiful and we're going to start -- we are going to start winning for our country.",
	"We're going to start winning.",

	"Mexico is killing us -- absolutely.",
	"We'll do the wall.",
	"We're going to do the wall.",
	"Mexico's going to pay for the wall and it's very easy.",
	"The other politicians come down, ",
	"you can't get Mexico to pay for the wall.",
	" We have a $58 billion trade deficit with Mexico.",
	"The wall is going to cost $10 to $12 billion, OK? Believe me, they will pay.",
	"One of the officials -- actually, one of the ex-officials from Mexico had a news conference.",
	"And he announced that we will not be paying for the wall.",
	"Trump think he is? They came to me -- the press.",
	"These people -- look at all those cameras back there.",
	"The press came to me and they told me that he said that he would not pay for the wall.",

	"We've had so many -- we've had so many incredible endorsements and to me getting the greatest business people to endorse me is very important.",
	"Carl Icahn endorsed me, so many others have endorsed me.",
	"And we're going to put these great business people in charge of trade and when China wants to come and negotiate, they're going to negotiate not with a political hack which is what they have now.",

	"But we need a tough tone.",
	"They're beheading our people in I mean, they're beheading Christians, the world is going no, but you know what? The tone has to be tougher.",
	"If we're going to stop ISIS, if we're going to clean up the border and stop what's happening at the border which is a disaster, which I was very proud to have brought up and took a lot of heat the first week, now everyone's apologizing to me because they see that I was right.",

	"Because I think that he has set a very poor standard.",
	"I think that he has set a very low bar and I think it's a shame for the African American people.",
	"And by the way, he has done nothing for African Americans.",
	"You look at what's gone on with their income levels.",
	"You look at what's gone on with their youth.",

	"And I think that I will win the African American vote and I think I will win the Hispanic vote.",
	"And if you see the recent polls that came out, Jon, you'll see that because I'm leading in the Hispanic vote.",

	"I wouldn't want to put any names out there right now.",
	"I think it's far too early.",
	"I want to see.",
	"And I'm certainly looking at the field.",
	"And there are certainly some tremendous people that we could put in, but it would be somebody that's very strong, very smart, and you know what else would be important, very energetic.",
	"You need a lot of energy.",
	"Well, I don't think she'd want to, because at the the answer is you know, I like Sarah Palin a lot.",
	"I think Sarah Palin has got the very unfair press.",
	"I think the press has treated her very unfairly.",
	"But I would pick somebody that would be a terrific you know, you have to view it as really who would be a good president in case something happened.",
	"But I would there are many, many people out there that I think would be very good.",
	"I will tell you this, I am leading in every poll, and in some cases by a tremendous margin, and people are a little bit surprised, but I'm not surprised.",
	"And people that know me aren't surprised, because they see what's going on with this country.",
	"If I'm treated fairly by and don't win, but if I'm treated fairly by the Republican Party, I would have no interest in doing that.",

	"I’m a Presbyterian and I had mentioned that, and I did say I don’t know about it.",
	"And, in fact, those are my exact words.",
	"So I just really don't know about the Seventh Day Adventists.",
	"I just -- you know, and that’s what I said.",
	"No, not at all.",
	"In fact, I think nationwide, I’m beating Ben with the Evangelicals.",
	"But, no, not at all.",
	"I just don’t know about that particular religion.",
	"Because I just said, I don’t know about it.",
	"I said nothing about it.",
	"I would never say bad.",
	"I’d never say bad about any religion.",
	"And, as you know, in fact, I think you just had a quote on, I said exactly I don’t know about it.",
	"-- that’s not an insult.",
	"Well, I didn’t say anything bad about it.",
	"I just don’t know about it.",
	"I would certainly give an apology if I said something bad about it.",
	"All I said was I don’t know about it.",
	"Well, it’s totally practical and, frankly, people can come and -- you know, legally come in with work visas and other ways to come and, you know, solve agricultural problems if they have that.",
	"But, frankly, you know, Ben is extremely weak, as you know, on illegal immigration and you can’t have that now.",
	"We have to have a country of borders.",
	"We need strength in our country.",
	"And you can’t be weak on illegal immigration.",
	"He is for amnesty and I’m for a very strong border.",
	"If we had strong borders, if we had strong rules and regulations, you might not have had the collapse, which was the big story a couple of days ago, the collapse and the attack of the World Trade Center.",
	"So we have very weak rules on immigration and I’m for making them strong and solid, like a country should have.",
	"And Ben is very weak on that subject.",
	"Yes and through very good management that will happen and the people that are really good and outstanding and have had outstanding records will come back in and they’ll come back in legally.",
	"They’re going to come back in legally so we have a country.",
	"And the bad ones -- and you know there are many bad -- you have -- I have been so right on that subject and I think it’s one of the reasons I’m leading in virtually every national poll and most, almost every state poll, frankly, including, by the way, some in Iowa.",
	"But it’s one of the reasons -- is illegal immigration -- they’ll come in legally.",
	"The ones that are bad -- and we have some real bad ones in this country -- they’re going to get out so fast your head will spin.",
	"Well, I’m OK with the savings accounts.",
	"I think it’s a good idea; it’s a very down-the-middle idea.",
	"It’s something that’s proven.",
	"The one thing we have to do is repeal and replace ObamaCare.",
	"It is a disaster.",
	"People’s -- I don’t know if you have been watching lately over the last couple of weeks -- people’s premiums, George, are going up 35 percent, 45 percent, 55 percent.",
	"Their deductibles are so high nobody’s ever going to get to use it.",
	"So it is -- ObamaCare is turning out to be a bigger disaster than anybody thought.",
	"Forget about the $5 billion website; that was the beginning.",
	"That was really the beginning of the end.",
	"ObamaCare is a disaster.",
	"You’re going to have to look at that, but I’ll tell you what, the health savings accounts, I’ve been talking about it also.",
	"I think it’s a very good idea and it’s a -- it’s an idea whose probably time has come.",
	"Well, in Iowa he is.",
	"Not everywhere else, because everywhere else I see -- they’re all different people all over the lot, all scattered all over the place.",
	"New Hampshire is totally different.",
	"In New Hampshire I have a massive lead and we have different seconds.",
	"You look at different states, it seems to be a lot of different people.",
	"But certainly in Iowa, he got a lot of PR by going a little bit ahead of me in Iowa.",
	"But we’ll see what happens because I find it hard to believe.",
	"I was in Iowa three days ago; we had such an unbelievable turnout that I find it really difficult to believe that I’m in second place.",
	"But we’ll find out.",
	"Well, all I’m saying is he’s not going to get the job done.",
	"He doesn’t have the temperament for it.",
	"He doesn’t have -- you know, I used the word energy, but -- and, by the way, Ben Carson’s a very low energy person also.",
	"Hey, look, we’re being ripped off by the entire world.",
	"You look at what’s going on, our trade deals with China, with Japan, with Mexico, with everybody.",
	"We lose with every single thing.",
	"You need somebody that’s done it before; you need somebody that has that real ability to bring our country back, to make our country rich again and we can do that and, therefore, to also, without the money, without the rich, we can’t make it great again, George.",
	"Bush does not have that.",
	"Jeb does not have that.",
	"It’s not for him.",
	"And, you know, I hate to see what’s happening with him, but his campaign is a disaster.",
	"He’s paid one person $1.3 million, some finance director, paid him $1.3 million -- that’s almost more than I paid for my whole deal.",
	"His -- you know, when I look at what I’ve done, I’m number one in virtually every poll and I spent less money than any other candidate that’s running.",
	"That’s what we do for our country, George.",
	"Oh, I don’t mind doing that at all.",
	"By the way, Ben Carson, you know, Ben is spending a lot of money on ads.",
	"He’s -- his super PAC is running Iowa for him, which shouldn’t be.",
	"I’m asking everybody to disavow their super PACs, like I do.",
	"I don’t want any money from anybody.",
	"I’m self-funding my campaign.",
	"But Ben, he’s being led by his super PACs.",
	"And if the super PACs in Iowa are doing a lot of the work for him and that’s not supposed to be happening, that’s not the way it’s supposed to work.",
	"Well, I don’t think so, because you know, one by one they’re dropping out.",
	"I’m against -- I was against 16 other candidates and, you know, I’m being divisive right now because I want to win.",
	"I know how to win; that’s what I have to do.",
	"Ultimately if I do win, I’m going to be a great unifier, George.",
	"I will be a great unifier for the country.",
	"The country right now is terribly divided by a president that doesn’t know how to lead and he’s a very divisive person.",
	"I will be a great unifier.",
	"You will be surprised to see that but you will see that.",
	"Well, I think that’s true.",
	"I think if Hillary Clinton gets elected, the country will go further down.",
	"It will down to a lower level than it is right now.",
	"We owe $19 trillion; we’re the laughingstock all over the world.",
	"Our military doesn’t perform because it’s not allowed to perform and it’s not in great shape, as you know.",
	"All you have to do is speak to the generals.",
	"It’s in probably the worst shape it’s been in in 50 years.",
	"Our country is in serious trouble.",
	"We make deals for Bergdahl; we make the Iran pact, which is one of the worst contracts I’ve ever seen negotiated and one of the dumbest.",
	"No, our country’s in bad shape and if we have Hillary, it will just get worse.",
	"Well, I think that’s a good thing to focus on.",
	"I think it’s excellent.",
	"I don’t think he’ll have the chance to do it but I think it’s an excellent thing to focus on.",
	"Don’t forget, in my book, written in 2000, I was the one that predicted Osama bin Laden would trouble -- was trouble, and you better do something about him.",
	"Well, guess what? 19 months later, he came down and knocked out the World Trade Center, killed thousands of Americans.",
	"I put it in a book.",
	"In fact, a couple of your competitors were saying, whoa, they just saw that yesterday or the other day.",
	"And they said, whoa, Trump actually mentioned Osama bin Laden and that we better do something about him or we’re going to have problems.",
	"That was before the World Trade Center came down.",
	"So I know much more about this stuff than Bush or anybody else running, believe me.",
	"Thank you very much, George.",
	"You want to have a mess of a country, you want to have nothing but problems, you want to have a country that's going to go to hell, you have Hillary elected president, you're going to have a country that's going to hell, I'll tell you right now.",
	"We need to have our borders.",
	"We need to make great deals.",
	"You look at your gov -- you look at Baltimore, you look at Ferguson, you look at lot of these places, a lot of these gangs -- and the most vicious -- are illegals.",
	"They're out of here.",
	"First day, I will send them people -- we.",
	"Those guys are out of here.",
	"I don't think so.",
	"I think they're the same.",
	"I think that Hillary may be very damaged, however, George because of the email thing.",
	"You look at General Petraeus, what's happened to him, how he's been destroyed and what he did was a fraction of what she's done.",
	"But I don't know.",
	"Assuming she could get over that, which I just don't know how she possibly can, but assuming she could I would say it would be pretty equal.",
	"Well, first of all they're wrong.",
	"And, you know, Jeb is a very low energy person.",
	"He'd never be able to do it.",
	"He's the one that said they come out of an act of love, OK.",
	"This is an act of love.",
	"These are people coming and many of them -- you look at what's happening with the crime.",
	"Many of them are really causing tremendous problems.",
	"And they would be out really fast, immediately.",
	"First day we start that movement.",
	"We need a wall.",
	"We have to get a wall.",
	"We need great security.",
	"And we're going to have a wall that will be not let people in, George.",
	"And, by the way, legally, if you're legal you can come in.",
	"And we'll cherish you for coming in.",
	"Well, it's costing us $130 billion a year and that's peanuts compared to what the real cost is, George, for the way we have it now.",
	"You have so many illegals.",
	"We don't even know how many illegals.",
	"I hear 11 million.",
	"I hear 30 million.",
	"The government has no idea.",
	"We have lost control of our country.",
	"We've lost control of our borders.",
	"The government has no idea how many illegals there.",
	"I've been hearing 11 million for five years.",
	"Then the other day I heard 30.",
	"Nobody has any idea...",
	"George, it's called management.",
	"And the first thing we have to do is secure the border.",
	"But it's called management.",
	"And we'll get people back in, the really good ones, we're going to expedite it, so they get back in, so they can at least come in legally.",
	"But we have to do it...",
	"George, I'm telling you, it's called management.",
	"You can do this and we can expedite the good ones to come back in.",
	"And everybody wants that.",
	"But they have to come in legally.",
	"We have a country, we have to have -- we're a country of laws.",
	"We're a country of borders.",
	"How can you have a country without a border?",
	"How can you have a country without laws?",
	"We have to do it.",
	"And by the way, what you said in your piece initially is the gang members.",
	"You look at the gang members in Baltimore, Chicago, in Ferguson, these people, a lot of them, are illegals.",
	"These are rough dudes.",
	"And we're going to get them to hell out fast.",
	"-- my specifics, George.",
	"But my specifics are very sample -- I'm going to get great people that know what they're doing, not a bunch of political hacks that have no idea what they're doing, appointed by President Obama, that doesn't have a clue.",
	"I mean that man doesn't have a clue.",
	"People are walking across the border right now, right in front of these great people that we have.",
	"We have wonderful Border Patrol people.",
	"They can do their job.",
	"but they're not allowed to do the job.",
	"People are walking right into our country totally un -- nobody even knows where they come from.",
	"They walk right past guards that are told not to do anything.",
	"I don't know what's going to happen.",
	"I can tell you this, we have to have a country -- we're a country of laws and we have to do it that way, George.",
	"There's nothing we can do about it if we're going to -- if we're going to stand as a country.",
	"We have no choice.",
	"We have to do it properly.",
	"Now, the candidates that are running against me like -- like Jeb Bush, he has no clue.",
	"He's never going to be able to do anything.",
	"You just looked at what's happened with him over the years and what's happened with -- the last thing we need is another Bush.",
	"But Scott Walker has changed his mind now, because he keeps going back to his pollster, and his pollster says, oh, Trump has a good idea, oh, Trump has a bad idea, oh, no, wait a minute, Trump has a good idea.",
	"These people don't know what they're doing, George.",
	"They don't know management.",
	"I get the best people and we will do it properly and we will do it humanely and get the good ones back in.",
	"Well, you'll hear it, George.",
	"Don't worry about it.",
	"It's called good management and it's called great people.",
	"No, that's totally false.",
	"I don't know where this comes from.",
	"I'm just hearing it for the first time.",
	"I don't mind Jeb Bush.",
	"I think he's a nice person.",
	"I just don't think he has the energy -- you need energy for this job.",
	"You need -- you can't be soft.",
	"And we need -- we're a country that's in trouble.",
	"We owe $18 trillion.",
	"It's going to be up to $20 trillion in a very short period of time, which is a very, very border number, when you hit over $20 trillion.",
	"And we need a person with a lot of smarts, a lot of cunning and a lot of energy.",
	"And Jeb doesn't have that.",
	"I think he's a very nice person.",
	"If he came president -- if he became president, good luck.",
	"It's going to be the same old story.",
	"But I have nothing against Jeb Bush.",
	"I think he's a very nice person.",
	"I've had very few failures, George.",
	"And if I do have a failure, I try and make it a success.",
	"for instance, if a market collapses in the midst of a big construction job, which I've had happen a number of times, in some cases, I've made those jobs more successful.",
	"I go back to the banks.",
	"I fight with them.",
	"I do all sorts of things.",
	"And I've had deals that should have been disasters and would have been for most people and they've become great successes, actually more successful than if the market had stayed good.",
	"But I would say this more than anything else, you have to learn from tough times.",
	"And I've learned a lot.",
	"Well, I'm not worried because his state is really in trouble.",
	"I mean it's a fantastic place.",
	"It -- I love the people of Wisconsin, but if you look at what's going on, they have a $2.2 billion deficit.",
	"They were supposed to have a surplus of $1 billion and they have $2.2 billion.",
	"There's tremendous divisions throughout the state.",
	"The roads are being built properly.",
	"The -- you know, he stopped a lot of work because he doesn't want to raise taxes.",
	"So instead of raising taxes, he's borrowing to the hilt and the state is very overleveraged.",
	"And it's number 38 out of the states.",
	"It's number -- it's ranked number 38.",
	"So, you know, I -- I'm honored that he wants to copy me and he's a nice man.",
	"He was up -- I -- I gave him campaign contributions when he was running for governor.",
	"I like him very much.",
	"But his state has not performed well.",
	"we need somebody that's going to make it perform well, this country perform well.",
	"And I'm the -- I'm the one to do it.",
	"I will do a great job.",
	"And people are seeing that and it's being reflected in the polls.",
	"I mean Reuters just came out with a brand new poll yesterday, 32 percent for Trump.",
	"I mean people want to see real change, not Obama change.",
	"He used the word change.",
	"His change was a bad change.",
	"They want to see proper change.",
	"They want to see great change.",
	"They want to see our country be great again, George.",
	"Thank you very much.",
	"I know nothing about him.",
	"I think he's got less than 1 percent in the poll.",
	"And I did see my beautiful building on television.",
	"It's a beautiful -- tallest building in Las Vegas.",
	"I'm very proud of it.",
	"The most beautiful building in Las Vegas.",
	"I know he was in front.",
	"Martin O'Malley was there to try and get some publicity, which he desperately needs.",
	"A lot of times --",
	"And our country is going to hell.",
	"I actually think I have the best temperament.",
	"I'm not the one with the trigger.",
	"Other people up here, believe me, would be a lot faster.",
	"If you noticed, he didn't answer your question.",
	"We're going win with Trump.",
	"And people back down with Trump.",
	"Yes, and he wants to be a tough guy and it doesn’t work very well with --",
	"-- a lot of times -- a lot of times -- that's all of his donors and special interests out there.",
	"So it's what it is.",
	"It was a great debate.",
	"We had some fun.",
	"I had a great time and I'm very happy with the results.",
	"Not a parking lot.",
	"And you know what I did?",
	"I let the court stand as opposed to going higher up.",
	"But let me -- we could have gone higher.",
	"But let me just tell you, George, I decided not to do it.",
	"I decided not to pursue it.",
	"We could have --",
	"We could have gone a different way.",
	"I offered her a lot of money.",
	"She ended up selling the house for much less money than I offered her.",
	"Eminent domain is a very important thing.",
	"Jeb Bush doesn't understand what it means.",
	"And if you look into the Bush family -- I found this out five minutes ago.",
	"They used eminent domain for the stadium in Texas, where they own, I guess, a piece of the Texas Rangers.",
	"It was the Bush family.",
	"They used private eminent domain.",
	"He didn't tell anybody this.",
	"So I mean, he should have told people.",
	"Maybe -- he probably doesn't know because I don't even think he knows what eminent domain is.",
	"But I just found that out five minutes ago.",
	"Eminent domain is important.",
	"You wouldn't have highways, you wouldn’t have roadways, you wouldn’t have bridges, you wouldn’t have hospitals.",
	"You wouldn't have anything without it.",
	"The Keystone Pipeline, everybody wants the Keystone Pipeline.",
	"If you're a conservative, you want the Keystone Pipeline.",
	"They have a whole section on eminent domain.",
	"When they write up, the whole thing, on the Keystone.",
	"They have a whole section right now --",
	"The crowd was on my side except they were all friends of mine that were donors and special interests and lobbyists, some of whom worked for me in the past.",
	"It was -- actually, it was a very -- it shows how broken the system is.",
	"The people in that audience were the people that were supporting all of the candidates.",
	"I'm the only candidate not taking money.",
	"I'm not taking money.",
	"I had 20 tickets.",
	"I mean, they gave me 20 tickets.",
	"Hey, George, all of those people in that crowd, 90 percent of them were people that gave to the various candidates and mostly to Bush.",
	"Look, Bush got $128 million.",
	"He spent over $100 million on this failed campaign of his.",
	"Those people were in the audience.",
	"So every time anybody said anything, in fact, Rubio actually said, he said, why does nobody get any response but Bush?",
	"I just think it's really showing the system.",
	"When you have somebody like me, where I don't take money, where I'm a self-funder, people really appreciate that.",
	"And that's why I brought it out last night.",
	"It was a good point, I think.",
	"But I brought it out last night.",
	"Well, George, you're not talking about what I said before that.",
	"I said we're living in a world where, in the Middle East, they're cutting people's heads off.",
	"They're chopping a Christian's head off.",
	"And many of them, we talk about Foley, James Foley, and you know, what a wonderful young man.",
	"Boom, they're chopping heads.",
	"So then I went into this.",
	"I said, yes, I would bring back waterboarding.",
	"And I would make it a hell of a lot worse than waterboarding.",
	"I had in mind going worse than waterboarding.",
	"We have right now a country that's under siege.",
	"It's under siege from a people, from -- we're like living in medieval times.",
	"If I have it to do and if it's up to me, I would absolutely bring back waterboarding.",
	"And if it's going to be tougher than waterboarding, I would bring that back, too.",
	"I would absolutely authorize something beyond waterboarding.",
	"And believe me, it will be effective.",
	"If we need information, George, you have our enemy cutting heads off of Christians and plenty of others, by the hundreds, by the thousands.",
	"You have to do it that way.",
	"And I'm not sure everybody agrees with me.",
	"I guess a lot of people don't.",
	"We are living in a time that's as evil as any time that there has ever been.",
	"You know, when I was a young man, I studied Medieval times.",
	"That's what they did, they chopped off heads.",
	"That's what we have...",
	"We're going to do things beyond waterboarding perhaps, if that happens to come.",
	"The question was asked.",
	"I thought Ted's answer was very tentative, Ted Cruz.",
	"He gave a very tentative answer.",
	"If we have to, we're going to have to do more.",
	"But when you have conditions like that, I would say absolutely, I would approve waterboarding and if you go beyond it, I'm OK with that.",
	"Well, no, you had to have it reclassified.",
	"You reclassify and you'll see what happens.",
	"But I would certainly approve waterboarding.",
	"They laugh at us.",
	"Our enemies laugh at us, George.",
	"They say waterboarding, they don't even think it's a form -- you know, they don't even view that as real torture.",
	"But they say waterboarding and they chop off heads.",
	"They think we are so stupid, you have no idea.",
	"The enemy that we are fighting -- and no wonder they're doing so well, because with this kind of thinking, that's why they're doing so well.",
	"In 2003-2004, I was against the war.",
	"That's probably the first time.",
	"Now, again, I wasn't a politician, George.",
	"I'm not somebody that you would interview.",
	"I was a businessman.",
	"But the point is -- yes, I was, actually.",
	"Maybe I should have done it.",
	"I like this one better.",
	"I like this time better.",
	"But the fact is that in 2003-2004, I was very much opposed to the Iraq War.",
	"I said it's going to destabilize the Middle East.",
	"It exactly destabilized the Middle East.",
	"And, you know, again, we're going to bring people together.",
	"And that's your thing and other people have their thing.",
	"We have to bring all people together.",
	"And if we don't, we're not going to have a country anymore.",
	"I'm talking about bringing people together and we -- I would appoint justices.",
	"It would take a long time, frankly, because I don't know how long it would take to appoint a...",
	"If they -- if they -- I would appoint them and we will see how they will vote but I would...",
	"I mean we're going to find out.",
	"There's a lot of people that want to see that.",
	"But I would, I'd -- more important than anything else to me, this country is so divided right now, as per her question.",
	"This country is so totally divided, it's probably almost never been as divided as it is right now and we have to bring it together.",
	"It has -- it has really been determined and we will see what happens.",
	"We're going to look at judges.",
	"They've got to be great judges.",
	"They've got to be conservative judges.",
	"We're going to see how they stand depending on -- on what their views are.",
	"But that would be my preference.",
	"I would prefer that they stand against it, but we'll see what happens.",
	"It depends on the judge.",
	"Well, I think what will happen is -- and, look, George, it's very simple.",
	"We're going to bring our country together.",
	"We're going to unify our country.",
	"We're going to do whatever we have to do.",
	"I'm going to put the absolute bed -- best judges in position.",
	"If their views -- we're going to see what their views are.",
	"I will make the determination at that time.",
	"Well, I think I understand what they're saying and we're going to see what happens.",
	"It's a long way off, George.",
	"It's a long way off.",
	"I think we're doing well.",
	"I think it's going well.",
	"I think our ground forces are good.",
	"I think I had a good debate last night.",
	"Well, I think I did very well in Iowa.",
	"I came in first or second, depending on how you want to count the Carson vote.",
	"I mean depending on how you want to count that, I came in either first or second out of originally 17 people.",
	"Well, I'll tell you what, if you add up all of the thousands of votes that were added onto Cruz, you know, you'll see what happens.",
	"I mean I think I might have come in better than second.",
	"But it doesn't matter.",
	"I think second a very good finish.",
	"You know, Rubio came in third.",
	"Every -- everybody was saying what a great job he did.",
	"I came in second and they said, oh, he had a bad performance.",
	"And I said why is that bad?",
	"I mean I came in second, he came in third, he was good and I wasn't?",
	"I mean, I don't know.",
	"He had a rough time, but, you know, we'll see what happens.",
	"I mean we have a -- an interesting two days ahead.",
	"But I wanted to get by the debate.",
	"People said I won the debate.",
	"Almost everybody said I won the debate.",
	"Even you said I did well.",
	"And we'll see what happens.",
	"It's a long way to go, George.",
	"To me, it's a long way to go.",
	"I mean I see these wonderful poll numbers, but they don't mean anything to me.",
	"I just don't know about polls.",
	"I don't know if they're accurate.",
	"When they interview 300 people and then they come up with this brilliant poll, to me, the people in New Hampshire have to get out, have to vote and hopefully they're going to vote for Trump, because I'm going to do a good job.",
	"Thank you very much.",
	"This has been an amazing evening.",
	"Already, we’ve won five major states and it looks like we could win six or seven or eight or nine.",
	"It’s really been — it’s really been great.",
	"I want to congratulation Ted on the winning of Texas.",
	"He worked hard on he — I know how hard he worked actually, and so I congratulate Ted Cruz on that win.",
	"That was an excellent win.",
	"We’re going to make America great again, folks.",
	"We’re going to make it great again.",
	"And, you know, I watched Hillary’s speech and she’s talking about wages have been poor and everything’s poor and everything’s doing badly, but we’re going to make it — she’s been there for so long.",
	"I mean, if she hasn’t straightened it out by now, she’s not going to straighten it out in the next four years.",
	"It’s just going to become worse and worse.",
	"She wants to make America whole again and I’m trying to figure out what is that all about.",
	"Make America great again is going to be much better than making America whole again.",
	"So I just want to say that this was an exciting evening.",
	"It’s so great to be in Florida.",
	"It’s so great to be at Mar-A-Lago with friends and the press and the media and everybody.",
	"I know it was a very tough night for Marco Rubio.",
	"He had a tough night but he worked hard.",
	"He spent a lot of money.",
	"He is a lightweight, as I’ve said many times before.",
	"But you know what? We’re going to go to Florida, we’re going to spend so much time in Florida.",
	"We’ve got about a 20-point lead.",
	"I know that a lot of groups, a lot of the special interests and a lot of the lobbyists and the people that want to have their little senator do exactly as they want, they’re going to put $20 million or $25 million into it over the next two weeks, from what just came over the wires.",
	"And frankly, I think that’s fine.",
	"As far as I’m concerned, it’s fine.",
	"And if he wins, they’ll have totally controlled — total control.",
	"But he’s not going anywhere anyway, but we’ll see what happens.",
	"But we’re going to spend a lot of time in Florida.",
	"The Virginia one was just a great win because it’s a place that is just spectacular and a place that we have big investments in, as we have in Florida.",
	"Remember, we have thousands of employees in Florida, all along Miami, Doral and Mar-A-Lago and so many other places.",
	"And it’s been an amazing place to invest.",
	"It’s been amazing to have so many wonderful employees, so many of whom are here tonight, really urging us on.",
	"And you know, I have thousands of employees all over the country, actually, all over the world but for purposes of tonight, we’ll just say all over the country.",
	"And it’s been just so beautiful to watch this company grow and to watch it grow so strongly.",
	"Recent articles came out talking about how great a company we built, and now we want to put that same ability into doing something for our nation.",
	"I mean, our nation is in serious trouble.",
	"We’re being chilled on trade, absolutely destroyed.",
	"China is just taking advantage of us.",
	"I have nothing against China.",
	"I have great respect for China, but their leaders are too smart for our leaders.",
	"Our leaders don’t have a clue and the trade deficits at $400 billion and $500 are too much.",
	"No country can sustain that kind of trade deficit.",
	"It won’t be that way for long.",
	"We have the greatest business leaders in the world on my team already and, believe me, we’re going to redo those trade deals and it’s going to be a thing of beauty.",
	"You look at countries like Mexico, where they’re killing us on the border, absolutely destroying us on the border.",
	"They’re destroying us in terms of economic development.",
	"Companies like Carrier Air Conditioner just moving into Mexico.",
	"Ford, moving into Mexico.",
	"Nabisco, closing up shop in Chicago and moving into Mexico.",
	"We have to stop it, folks.",
	"I know how to stop it.",
	"We’re going to create jobs.",
	"We’re going to create jobs like you’ve never seen.",
	"We’re going to lower taxes.",
	"I have a plan that Larry Kudlow and so many others think is the best plan they’ve seen.",
	"We’re going to lower taxes substantially for the middle class.",
	"The middle class has been forgotten in our country.",
	"It really helped and really probably was the predominant factor in making our country into a country that we all love so much and we’re all so proud of, but we’ve forgotten the middle class.",
	"So we’re going to lower taxes.",
	"We’re lowering taxes on business.",
	"You look at all the companies that are moving out.",
	"When you see Pfizer moving to Ireland and you see so many other companies, constantly now they’re leaving.",
	"They used to move from New York to Florida, or they’d move from New Jersey to someplace else, Chris.",
	"But now they’re moving from here  not that many people are leaving New Jersey.",
	"But Chris understands the problem, fully understands.",
	"Now they’re leaving from places that they used to move to into other parts of the world.",
	"We can’t let that happen.",
	"We’ve lost our manufacturing jobs.",
	"We’ve lost our manufacturing.",
	"Millions and millions of jobs, thousands and thousands and thousands of plants, manufacturing plants, warehouses.",
	"I mean, we are losing so much.",
	"We can’t let it happen.",
	"I tell the story often about a friend of mine who is in the excavation business and he always orders Caterpillar.",
	"And recently, he ordered Komatsu tractors from Japan because they’ve cut the yen.",
	"They’ve devalued the yen to such an extent that it was virtually impossible for Caterpillar to compete.",
	"And I don’t want that to happen.",
	"That’s not going to happen.",
	"They shouldn’t be allowed to do it.",
	"We have tremendous power over everybody because we are really the source.",
	"We have great, great power.",
	"The problem is we have politicians who truly, truly, truly don’t know what they’re doing.",
	"So we’re going to work very, very hard.",
	"I’m so honored by this evening.",
	"If you would’ve told me on June 16th, when I was with my wife, Melania, and we came down the escalator in Trump Tower and it looked, literally, well, a little bit like this.",
	"You have a lot of cameras here tonight.",
	"It looked, literally, like the Academy Awards.",
	"I never saw so many cameras in my life.",
	"And it takes courage to run.",
	"I’ll tell you what, it takes a lot of courage to run for president.",
	"I’ve never done this before.",
	"I’ve been a job-producer.",
	"I’ve done a lot of things but this is something I’ve never done, but I felt we had to do it.",
	"When you look at the incompetence of the Iran deal, where we give $150 billion, we get absolutely nothing.",
	"When you look at all of the problems our country has and you look at our military, which is really being depleted rapidly, depleted.",
	"We’re going to make our military bigger and better and stronger than ever before, and nobody, nobody, nobody is going to mess with us, folks, nobody.",
	"So it’s just an amazing honor to have you with me tonight.",
	"And if you want, press, I think we told you before we’d be okay if you want to ask a few questions.",
	"Well, they can always do that and then they’ll — then they’ll just lose everything and that would be the — that would be the work of a loser.",
	"But let me just explain something.",
	"If you’ve seen what’s happened, whether you go to South Carolina, where I had a huge victory, where we had a tremendous victory in New Hampshire, tremendous in Nevada, you look at what’s happened, and tonight, of course, is the best of all.",
	"I mean, right now, they’re projected I guess six, but we could be seven, eight, nine, and major states.",
	"It’s Georgia, Alabama, Massachusetts, Tennessee, Virginia.",
	"And you know, these are amazing states and we’re going to probably get a lot more.",
	"In fact, we’re projected to have some pretty good additional numbers.",
	"But I will say this.",
	"Look, we have expanded the Republican Party.",
	"When you look at what’s happened in South Carolina and you see the kind of numbers that we got, in terms of extra people coming in.",
	"They came from the Democratic Party, or the Democrat Party, and they’re Democrats and they’re long-time Democrats and they were never going to switch and they all switched.",
	"And they were independents.",
	"And we’ve actually expanded the party.",
	"Look at the number of votes we had in that area, as an example.",
	"Four years ago, they had 390,000 or so votes.",
	"We were almost 800,000.",
	"Whereas the Democrats went down.",
	"There’s much less enthusiasm for the Democrats.",
	"So I — look, I’m a unifier.",
	"I know people are going to find that a little bit hard to believe, but believe me, I am a unifier.",
	"Once we get all of this finished, I’m going to go after one person, that’s Hillary Clinton, on the assumption she’s allowed to run, which is a big assumption.",
	"I don’t know that she’s going to be allowed to run.",
	"And I think that’s, frankly, going to be an easy race.",
	"You see the polls.",
	"I beat Hillary in many polls.",
	"I know one thing.",
	"I don’t think Marco is going to be able to beat her.",
	"I don’t think — in all fairness, I think Ted’s going to have a very hard time.",
	"But Ted at least has a shot because at least he’s won a little bit.",
	"So I just tell you this.",
	"We are going to be a much finer party, a much — we’re going to be a unified party, I mean, to be honest with you.",
	"And we are going to be a much bigger party, and you can see that happening.",
	"We’re going to be a much bigger party.",
	"Our party is expanding.",
	"And all you have to do it take a look at the primary states where I’ve won and just look — we’ve gone from X number to a much larger number.",
	"That hasn’t happened to the Republican Party in many, many decades.",
	"So I think we’re going to be more inclusive.",
	"I think we’re going to be more unified and I think we’re going to be a much bigger party, and I think we’re going to win in November.",
	"I’m just doing what’s right.",
	"Look, Planned Parenthood has done very good work for some — for many, many — for millions of women.",
	"And I’ll say it and I know a lot of the so-called conservatives, they say that’s really — because I’m a conservative, but I’m a common-sense conservative.",
	"But millions of women have been helped by Planned Parenthood.",
	"But we’re not going to allow and we’re not going to fund as long as you have the abortion going on at Planned Parenthood, and we understand that and I’ve said it loud and clear.",
	"But — and we’ll see what happens.",
	"But Planned Parenthood — millions of people — and I’ve had thousands of letters from women that have been helped.",
	"And this wasn’t a setup.",
	"This was people writing letters.",
	"I’m going to be really good for women.",
	"I’m going to be good for women’s health issues.",
	"It’s very important to me, very important to me.",
	"So Sarah, I mean, you know, you can call it what you want, but I am a truth-teller and I will tell the truth, OK?",
	"Yeah, go ahead, finish it.",
	"I feel awfully good.",
	"I mean, I’m watching your people — I’m watching your people on — and I’m going to be very nice, I’m going to be very nice — I’m watching your people on CNN and I’m watching the Fox people and I’m watching the MSNBC people, too, OK? See? I’m becoming diplomatic.",
	"And they are certainly being very nice to me tonight.",
	"I mean, you know, they’re being very strong.",
	"And they are, they’re declaring Marco Rubio the big loser of the night, which is true.",
	"He didn’t win anything.",
	"He hasn’t won anything, period.",
	"And by the way, and I have to tell you — and he was very, very nasty.",
	"I’ve never heard a person get up and speak on an evening like this and be so nasty, but he’s got a right to be nasty.",
	"He hasn’t won anything and he’s not going to win very much.",
	"But I do congratulate Ted because I know how hard Ted worked on Texas and it’s a big get.",
	"Now I also did very well in Texas.",
	"I came in second.",
	"And one of the things my son, Eric, told me, which I didn’t even realize, is that not only did I win most of the states — and some are coming in and I’m expected to win them — but I came in second — I came in no worse than second.",
	"So it wasn’t like I won and then I disappeared.",
	"The worst I had was a second.",
	"So I’m very, very honored by the turnout, OK?",
	"Oh, they’re totally wrong.",
	"I disavowed when I — in fact, Chris is my number one — Chris gave me the honor of joining the campaign.",
	"He said, “Donald, what you’ve got is a movement.” We spoke today in Kentucky.",
	"You’ve never seen a crowd like that.",
	"That had to be 20,000 people inside this massive convention center and it was incredible.",
	"And every place we’re speaking, if we have 10,000 people it’s like a small group.",
	"We had 35,000 people the other day in Alabama.",
	"And when Chris called, he said this is a movement; this is something like I’ve never seen.",
	"And in all fairness to the press, a lot of the press have said the same thing.",
	"They’ve never seen what’s happening right now.",
	"They’ve never seen anything like it.",
	"And I’m just honored by it.",
	"Now, when Chris joined, we had a news conference and they asked me the exact same question.",
	"I said I disavow.",
	"Now, right after the program that we’re talking about — and I thought it was clear, but you know, we’re talking about groups, groups, groups.",
	"I do have to know the name of the group because, who knows? I mean, they have to give me the name of the group.",
	"But right after, when I reviewed it, I put out a tweet and I put out on Facebook that I totally disavow.",
	"Now everybody knew I did that but the press refused to look at that.",
	"It was right after.",
	"And I disavowed then; I disavowed today on ABC with George Stephanopoulos, I disavowed again.",
	"I mean, how many times are you supposed to disavow? But I disavow and hopefully it’s the final time I have to do it.",
	"But if you look at Facebook and if you look at Twitter, right after the show I put out a statement because I want everybody to be sure.",
	"No, it’s not, but there is always going to be some negotiation, and it’s going to be a good negotiation, not a bad negotiation.",
	"It’s going to be a negotiation where we’ll start at certain levels and hopefully I will make a great deal, and lots of great deals, for the American people.",
	"So you know, look, you can’t go around just signing our little notices that the president signs all the time, executive orders, he’s done executive order, executive order.",
	"It’s almost like, I don’t even know.",
	"Does he ever go a deal with Congress anymore? Does he ever speak to the Senate? Does he ever speak with congressmen and get them into a room and get things done?",
	"You know, a good example of this, in all fairness, is something that I — is very, very important to me; corporate inversion.",
	"Carl Icahn, who’s a friend of mine who endorsed me, great businessman, he — it bothers him so much he calls me about it all the time, where we’re losing companies.",
	"And we’re losing for two reasons.",
	"We’re losing for a lot of reasons but the taxes are too high.",
	"We have the highest — we’re the highest taxed nation in the world.",
	"And very importantly, they have trillions, for companies, trillions of dollars outside of this country.",
	"The Democrats agree it should be brought back in.",
	"The Republicans agree it should be brought back in.",
	"Everybody agrees it should be brought back in.",
	"I could sit in a room — or the Oval Office — for a period of, literally, a half hour and I really believe I could get everybody — every single — you know, it’s one thing they don’t agree on health care or they don’t agree on common core or they don’t agree on other things and they’ll fight.",
	"Here’s something every single — I mean, almost everybody agrees.",
	"These trillions and trillions of dollars should be brought into the country.",
	"The president can’t make a deal.",
	"The reason is he doesn’t know how to make a deal, probably doesn’t work at it, probably doesn’t care, but you’re talking about tremendous number of — tremendous amounts of money.",
	"So when you have something that everybody wants and you can’t make a deal, there’s something going on that’s really wrong.",
	"And what it means is you have the wrong leader.",
	"Well, look, everything — we are going to have a wall.",
	"I can tell you we are going to have a wall.",
	"I watched the ex-president of Mexico, the arrogance of this man.",
	"And I get along great with Hispanics.",
	"You saw in Nevada, I won in the poll, the Hispanic vote.",
	"I have thousands of people that work for me right now that are Hispanic.",
	"I’ve had thousands and thousands over my lifetime.",
	"These are great people.",
	"The Mexican leaders are too smart for our leaders and you saw it.",
	"Vincente Fox, first of all, he used a word that you should never have — if I ever used that word you folks would’ve never, ever, ever let me get away with it.",
	"Nobody even talked about the word he used and this is the ultimate word.",
	"But he was angry at the concept of somebody saying that they were going to pay for the wall.",
	"Mexico is going to pay for the wall.",
	"We have a trade deficit with Mexico of $58 billion a year — $58 billion.",
	"The wall is going to cost $10 billion.",
	"I’ve had these guys that I’m on the stage with go you don’t really mean Mexico is going to pay for the wall.",
	"One — as sure as you’re standing there, 100 percent, Mexico’s going to pay, 100 percent.",
	"And the reason is I’m a businessman.",
	"I know how to do this.",
	"Politicians are all talk, no action.",
	"It’s not going to — except for Chris Christie, of course.",
	"It’s not — look, it’s not going to happen.",
	"It’s not going to happen with these people.",
	"So when you think of it — and then they say you’ll never be able to build a wall.",
	"Well, it’s 2,000 miles but we really need 1,000 miles.",
	"The Great Wall of China, built 2,000 years ago, is 13,000 miles, folks, and they didn’t have Caterpillar tractors, because I only want to use Caterpillar, if you want to know the truth, or John Deere.",
	"I buy a lot of equipment from John Deere.",
	"I love John Deere, too.",
	"But they didn’t have tractors.",
	"They didn’t have cranes.",
	"They didn’t have excavation equipment.",
	"The wall is 13,000 miles long.",
	"We need 1,000 miles and we have all of the materials.",
	"We can do that so beautifully.",
	"And this is going to be a serious wall.",
	"This is going to be high wall.",
	"This is going to be a very serious wall.",
	"We’re going to stop drugs from coming into New Hampshire.",
	"You know, when I won New Hampshire, those people were so incredible to me.",
	"And when you go, you wouldn’t believe it because it’s so bucolic, so beautiful.",
	"You look at the fields and you look at everything, it’s so beautiful.",
	"And yet, you go to a meeting in New Hampshire, their number one problem, their number one problem is heroine.",
	"The heroine is pouring in and they have so many of their young people and other people addicted.",
	"And I told them I’m going to stop it.",
	"I’m going to stop it.",
	"We’re going to have a strong border, and I mean strong.",
	"And by the way, speaking of people, people are going to come in and they’re going to come into this country, but they’re going to come in legally, OK?",
	"I have a lot of respect for Rick Scott.",
	"I don’t know about his endorsement but he’s a friend of mine.",
	"I have a lot of respect for Rick Scott.",
	"I’ve got to find out what’s going on.",
	"We’ve got a big problem.",
	"We have a big, big problem.",
	"I’ll tell it like it is.",
	"We have a big, big problem.",
	"We’ve got to figure it out.",
	"We’re going to figure it out.",
	"Radical Islamic terrorism, big, big problem, not only for us.",
	"You take a look at Germany, you take a look at Sweden, you take a look at Brussels.",
	"You look at some of these places, it’s like a disaster.",
	"And we’re not going to allow people to come into our country who we have no idea who they are, we have no idea where they come from, they have no paperwork, they’re young and they’re strong.",
	"You look at that migration line; they’re young, they’re strong, they’re powerful.",
	"And you say why aren’t they back fighting for their country?",
	"Now, with all of that being said, I feel strongly — I have a bigger heart than anybody.",
	"We’re going to build a safe zone.",
	"It’s going to be in Syria.",
	"And I’m going to get the Gulf states, who have more money than anybody — we’ve got to loosen up their wallets a little bit.",
	"We’re going to get — but they’re not accepting people.",
	"We’re going to get — wait, wait, wait.",
	"We’re going to get the Gulf states to pay for it because they should.",
	"You heard what I said.",
	"I gave you a good answer.",
	"You heard what I said.",
	"Oh, we’re going to bring them back.",
	"We’re going to bring them back.",
	"Look, I’m telling you — you know how I’m going to bring them back? First of all, we’re going to do great with the African- Americans, and you see that in the polls where I had in one poll where I’m 25 percent.",
	"And one of the commentators, who I think is standing right at the back of the room in the corner, said, you know, if Donald Trump gets 25 percent of the African-American vote, this election is over.",
	"And the reason I’m getting that — and I’m going to do great with the Hispanics.",
	"I’m going to do great with virtually every group.",
	"The reason is I’m going to bring jobs back.",
	"I’m going to get Apple to start making their computers and their iPhones on our land, not in China.",
	"How does it help us when they make it in China?",
	"So I’m going to create jobs.",
	"Well, look, I always liked Marco until about a week ago when he decided to go hostile.",
	"He decided to become Don Rickles, OK? But Don Rickles has a lot more talent.",
	"Honestly, I did, I always liked him but he became — you know, somebody told him you’re losing very badly.",
	"The only way you can possibly win, take the hail Mary, they called it a hail Mary, the folks in the back, and go hostile.",
	"In fact, one of the newscasts tonight said he went down 15 or 20 percent.",
	"It’s really hurt him.",
	"But look, I’m not going to tell him what to do.",
	"I’m not going to tell anybody what to do.",
	"You have to run.",
	"He had a bad night, according to CNN, Fox.",
	"I watched their broadcasts.",
	"They say the loser of the night was Marco Rubio and it’s true.",
	"He didn’t win anything.",
	"I mean, at least you can say that Ted has won something, and you know, Marco has not won.",
	"You’ve got to be able to win.",
	"You know, these politicians, all talk, no action.",
	"You’ve got to be able to win something.",
	"He hasn’t won anything.",
	"And he actually hasn’t come very close.",
	"So we’ll see what happens.",
	"Let’s not ask it again.",
	"How many times do I say — listen, who are you, by the way? Who do you — where are you with?",
	"Look, I don’t want to waste a lot of time.",
	"I’ve disavowed — OK, I’m going to get along great with Congress, OK? Paul Ryan, I don’t know him well but I’m sure I’m going to get along great with him.",
	"And if I don’t, he’s going to have to pay a big price, OK? OK.",
	"Yeah, go ahead, go ahead.",
	"On the right, go ahead.",
	"I’m going to be a good president for the world but we have a country that’s in big trouble.",
	"Our infrastructure is going to hell, our roads, our highways, our schools, our hospitals, our airports.",
	"I go throughout the world.",
	"I mean, you go to Qatar, you go to — some people say Qatar, but you go to Qatar, you go to any of — so many places.",
	"You go to different places in China, different places in Asia, different places in the Middle East, you look at some of the airports they have.",
	"You look at the roadways they have.",
	"You look at the transportation systems they have and the trains they have.",
	"We’re like a third world country.",
	"So I am going to be very good for the world.",
	"I’m going to get along with the world.",
	"You’re going to be very proud of me.",
	"Even you will be very proud of me as a president.",
	"But we have to rebuild our country.",
	"Our country is going to hell and people don’t understand that.",
	"And Hillary Clinton doesn’t have a clue.",
	"She can’t do that.",
	"She’s talking about — I mean, one of the things that has really bothered me, I think one of the reasons I have such great support, is that people, you take a look, people in the middle-income groups are making less money today — less money than they made 12 years ago.",
	"And in her speech, she just said they’re making less money.",
	"Well, she’s been there with Obama for a long period of time.",
	"Why hasn’t she done anything about it? Practically everything that she was complaining about — she’s picked up what I say.",
	"The difference is she’s been there for a long period of time.",
	"Why haven’t they done anything about it?",
	"Then you look at her record as secretary of State.",
	"You look at what’s going on with Syria.",
	"You look at what’s going on with everything.",
	"So we’re going to have an interesting period of time.",
	"I don’t know that she’s going to be allowed to run.",
	"What she did is a criminal act.",
	"If she’s allowed to run I would be very, very surprised.",
	"But if she’s allowed to run, honestly, it’ll be a sad day for this country because what she did was wrong.",
	"And what she did let me just tell you, what she did was wrong and other people have done far less than her and they paid a very, very big price.",
	"OK, one or two more questions.",
	"Yeah, go ahead, Jeremy.",
	"Where did I say that? Where did I say it, Jeremy? Where? Where? Where? Tell me where.",
	"I didn’t say that.",
	"If the walls going to be 50 feet, I’ll take two feet off the wall.",
	"You didn’t listen, Jeremy.",
	"At this moment, absolutely not, no.",
	"We either have a country or we don’t.",
	"We have a country, or we don’t.",

	"We have tremendous discontent in the country.",
	"We have tremendous problems in the country.",
	"And I felt it early on or I wouldn't have done this.",
	"But I see tremendous discontent.",
	"I would use the debt limit.",
	"I don't want to say -- I want to be unpredictable, because, you know, we need unpredictability.",
	"Everything is so predictable with our country.",
	"But I would be very, very strong on the debt limit.",
	"And I would be asking for a very big pound of flesh if I were the Republicans.",
	"And the problem with the Republicans, they have two sides.",
	"The smaller side is very strong and the other side is always agreeing and, you know, you can't do that.",
	"I do not want to say that because I want to show unpredictability.",
	"You can't just go around and say that.",
	"But Planned Parenthood should absolutely be defunded.",
	"I mean if you look at what's going on with that, it's terrible.",
	"And many other things should be defunded and many things should be cut.",
	"I'm fine with it, we have it, it's there.",
	"But it's coming to a time when maybe we don't need it.",
	"That would be a wonderful thing.",
	"I don't think we need it so much anymore.",
	"You know, it has served its place, it has served its time.",

	"We're making horrible trade deals.",
	"We are losing jobs in this country.",
	"Hundreds and hundreds of thousands of jobs are being lost.",
	"And part of the reason is our taxes are so high in this country.",
	"I'm also cutting, you know they don't talk about that.",
	"And I'm doing that in a different, little policy segment that we're going to be announcing-",
	"But we're going to be cutting tremendous amounts of money and waste and fraud and abuse.",
	"You know they had a case.",
	"I'm not cutting services.",
	"But I'm cutting spending.",
	"But I may cut Department of Education.",
	"I believe common core is a very bad thing.",
	"I believe that we should be lo -- you know, educating our children from Iowa, from New Hampshire, from South Carolina, from California, from New York.",
	"I think that it should be local education.",

	"Boeing's going over to China.",
	"They're going to build a massive plant because China's demanding it in order to order airplanes from Boeing.",
	"So Boeing now is going to China, building a massive plant.",
	"I don't want that.",
	"I don't want that.",
	"I didn't say wonderful, I say eminent domain is something you need Chris.",
	"Eminent domain - if I build a highway - go ahead.",
	"I know exactly what you're saying.",
	"But if I build a highway, and if something's in the way of the highway, you're going to have to do something with that.",
	"And by the way, people get paid for it.",
	"Everyone thinks they don't get paid.",
	"They get paid a lot of money.",
	"If somebody has a property in the middle of a 7,000 job factory, as an example, that's going to move into the town - but they need this one corner of this property, and it's going to provide 7,000 jobs in a community that's dying, of which we have many in this country, OK? I am for that.",
	"That's a big economic development.",
	"But remember this: all of these people that we're talking about, they're friends of mine.",
	"They all love the Keystone Pipeline, right?",
	"The Keystone Pipeline is all eminent domain.",
	"They're building that pipeline without eminent domain, you wouldn't be able to build.",
	"That was an economic development.",

	"All she wanted was money.",
	"Look, look, Jeb said we were safe with my brother.",
	"Well, the World Trade Center just fell down! Now, am I trying to blame him? I'm not blaming anybody.",
	"But the World Trade Center came down.",
	"So when he said, we were safe, that's not safe.",
	"We lost 3,000 people, it was one of the greatest - probably the greatest catastrophe ever in this country if you think about it, right?",
	"Well, I would have been much different, I must tell you.",
	"Somebody said, well, it wouldn't have been any different.",
	"Well, it would have been.",
	"I am extremely, extremely tough on illegal immigration.",
	"I'm extremely tough on people coming into this country.",
	"I believe that if I were running things, I doubt those families would have - I doubt that those people would have been in the country.",

	"Yes, they control them.",
	"Hey, I have lobbyists.",
	"I have to tell you.",
	"I have lobbyists that can produce anything for me.",
	"But you know what? it won’t happen.",
	"Because we have to stop doing things for some people, but for this country, it’s destroying our country.",
	"We have to stop, and it has to stop now.",
	"Now, our country needs — our country needs a truly great leader, and we need a truly great leader now.",
	"We need a leader that wrote The Art of the Deal.",
	"We need a leader that can bring back our jobs, can bring back our manufacturing, can bring back our military, can take care of our vets.",
	"Our vets have been abandoned.",
	"And we also need a cheerleader.",
	"You know, when President Obama was elected, I said, Well, the one thing, I think he’ll do well.",
	"I think he’ll be a great cheerleader for the country.",
	"I think he’d be a great spirit.",
	"I really thought that he would be a great cheerleader.",
	"He’s not a leader.",
	"You’re right about that.",
	"But he wasn’t a cheerleader.",
	"He’s actually a negative force.",
	"He’s been a negative force.",
	"He wasn’t a cheerleader; he was the opposite.",
	"We need somebody that can take the brand of the United States and make it great again.",
	"It’s not great again.",
	"We need — we need somebody — we need somebody that literally will take this country and make it great again.",
	"We can do that.",
	"And, I will tell you, I love my life.",
	"I have a wonderful family.",
	"They’re saying, Dad, you’re going to do something that’s going to be so tough.",
	"You know, all of my life, I’ve heard that a truly successful person, a really, really successful person and even modestly successful cannot run for public office.",
	"And yet that’s the kind of mindset that you need to make this country great again.",
	"So ladies and gentlemen…",
	"I am officially running…",
	"… for president of the United States, and we are going to make our country great again.",
	"Our country has tremendous potential.",
	"We have tremendous people.",
	"We have people that aren’t working.",
	"We have people that have no incentive to work.",
	"But they’re going to have incentive to work, because the greatest social program is a job.",
	"And they’ll be proud, and they’ll love it, and they’ll make much more than they would’ve ever made, and they’ll be — they’ll be doing so well, and we’re going to be thriving as a country, thriving.",
	"I will be the greatest jobs president that God ever created.",
	"I tell you that.",
	"I’ll bring back our jobs from China, from Mexico, from Japan, from so many places.",
	"I’ll bring back our jobs, and I’ll bring back our money.",
	"Right now, think of this: We owe China $1.3 trillion.",
	"We owe Japan more than that.",
	"So they come in, they take our jobs, they take our money, and then they loan us back the money, and we pay them in interest, and then the dollar goes up so their deal’s even better.",
	"How stupid are our leaders? How stupid are these politicians to allow this to happen? How stupid are they?",
	"I’m going to tell you — thank you.",
	"I’m going to tell you a couple of stories about trade, because I’m totally against the trade bill for a number of reasons.",
	"Number one, the people negotiating don’t have a clue.",
	"Our president doesn’t have a clue.",
	"He’s a bad negotiator.",
	"He’s the one that did Bergdahl.",
	"We get Bergdahl, they get five killer terrorists that everybody wanted over there.",
	"We get a traitor.",
	"We get a no-good traitor, and they get the five people that they wanted for years, and those people are now back on the battlefield trying to kill us.",
	"That’s the negotiator we have.",
	"Take a look at the deal he’s making with Iran.",
	"He makes that deal, Israel maybe won’t exist very long.",
	"It’s a disaster, and we have to protect Israel.",
	"So we need people — I’m a free trader.",
	"But the problem with free trade is you need really talented people to negotiate for you.",
	"If you don’t have talented people, if you don’t have great leadership, if you don’t have people that know business, not just a political hack that got the job because he made a contribution to a campaign, which is the way all jobs, just about, are gotten, free trade terrible.",
	"Free trade can be wonderful if you have smart people, but we have people that are stupid.",
	"We have people that aren’t smart.",
	"And we have people that are controlled by special interests.",
	"And it’s just not going to work.",
	"So, here’s a couple of stories happened recently.",
	"A friend of mine is a great manufacturer.",
	"And, you know, China comes over and they dump all their stuff, and I buy it.",
	"I buy it, because, frankly, I have an obligation to buy it, because they devalue their currency so brilliantly, they just did it recently, and nobody thought they could do it again.",
	"But with all our problems with Russia, with all our problems with everything — everything, they got away with it again.",
	"And it’s impossible for our people here to compete.",
	"So I want to tell you this story.",
	"A friend of mine who’s a great manufacturer, calls me up a few weeks ago.",
	"I said, What’s your problem?",
	"He said, You know, I make great product.",
	"And I said, I know.",
	"I know that because I buy the product.",
	"He said, I can’t get it into China.",
	"They won’t accept it.",
	"I sent a boat over and they actually sent it back.",
	"They talked about environmental, they talked about all sorts of crap that had nothing to do with it.",
	"I said, Oh, wait a minute, that’s terrible.",
	"Does anyone know this?",
	"He said, Yeah, they do it all the time with other people.",
	"I said, They send it back?",
	"So I finally got it over there and they charged me a big tariff.",
	"They’re not supposed to be doing that.",
	"Now, they do charge you tariff on trucks, when we send trucks and other things over there.",
	"They wanted Boeing’s secrets.",
	"They wanted their patents and all their secrets before they agreed to buy planes from Boeing.",
	"Hey, I’m not saying they’re stupid.",
	"I sell apartments for — I just sold an apartment for $15 million to somebody from China.",
	"Am I supposed to dislike them? I own a big chunk of the Bank of America Building at 1290 Avenue of the Americas, that I got from China in a war.",
	"The biggest bank in the world is from China.",
	"You know where their United States headquarters is located? In this building, in Trump Tower.",
	"People say, Oh, you don’t like China?",
	"No, I love them.",
	"But their leaders are much smarter than our leaders, and we can’t sustain ourself with that.",
	"There’s too much — it’s like — it’s like take the New England Patriots and Tom Brady and have them play your high school football team.",
	"That’s the difference between China’s leaders and our leaders.",
	"They are ripping us.",
	"We are rebuilding China.",
	"We’re rebuilding many countries.",
	"China, you go there now, roads, bridges, schools, you never saw anything like it.",
	"They have bridges that make the George Washington Bridge look like small potatoes.",
	"And they’re all over the place.",
	"We have all the cards, but we don’t know how to use them.",
	"We don’t even know that we have the cards, because our leaders don’t understand the game.",
	"We could turn off that spigot by charging them tax until they behave properly.",
	"Now they’re going militarily.",
	"They’re building a military island in the middle of the South China sea.",
	"Now, our country could never do that because we’d have to get environmental clearance, and the environmentalist wouldn’t let our country — we would never build in an ocean.",
	"They built it in about one year, this massive military port.",
	"They’re building up their military to a point that is very scary.",
	"You have a problem with ISIS.",
	"You have a bigger problem with China.",
	"And, in my opinion, the new China, believe it or not, in terms of trade, is Mexico.",
	"So this man tells me about the manufacturing.",
	"I say, That’s a terrible story.",
	"I hate to hear it.",
	"But I have another one, Ford.",
	"So Mexico takes a company, a car company that was going to build in Tennessee, rips it out.",
	"Everybody thought the deal was dead.",
	"Reported it in the Wall Street Journal recently.",
	"Everybody thought it was a done deal.",
	"It’s going in and that’s going to be it, going into Tennessee.",
	"Great state, great people.TRUMP: All of a sudden, at the last moment, this big car manufacturer, foreign, announces they’re not going to Tennessee.",
	"They’re gonna spend their $1 billion in Mexico instead.",
	"Now, Ford announces a few weeks ago that Ford is going to build a $2.5 billion car and truck and parts manufacturing plant in Mexico.",
	"$2.5 billion, it’s going to be one of the largest in the world.",
	"So I announced that I’m running for president.",
	"… one of the early things I would do, probably before I even got in — and I wouldn’t even use — you know, I have — I know the smartest negotiators in the world.",
	"I know the good ones.",
	"I know the bad ones.",
	"I know the overrated ones.",
	"You get a lot of them that are overrated.",
	"They think they are.",
	"They get good stories, because the newspapers get buffaloed.",
	"But they’re not good.",
	"But I know the negotiators in the world, and I put them one for each country.",
	"We will do very, very well, very, very well.",
	"But I wouldn’t even waste my time with this one.",
	"I would call up the head of Ford, who I know.",
	"If I was president, I’d say, Congratulations.",
	"I understand that you’re building a nice $2.5 billion car factory in Mexico and that you’re going to take your cars and sell them to the United States zero tax, just flow them across the border.",
	"And you say to yourself, How does that help us, right? How does that help us? Where is that good? It’s not.",
	"So I would say, Congratulations.",
	"That’s the good news.",
	"Let me give you the bad news.",
	"Every car and every truck and every part manufactured in this plant that comes across the border, we’re going to charge you a 35-percent tax, and that tax is going to be paid simultaneously with the transaction, and that’s it.",
	"Now, here’s what is going to happen.",
	"If it’s not me in the position, it’s one of these politicians that we’re running against, you know, the 400 people that we’re.",
	"And here’s what’s going to happen.",
	"They’re not so stupid.",
	"They know it’s not a good thing, and they may even be upset by it.",
	"But then they’re going to get a call from the donors or probably from the lobbyist for Ford and say, You can’t do that to Ford, because Ford takes care of me and I take care of you, and you can’t do that to Ford.",
	"And guess what? No problem.",
	"They’re going to build in Mexico.",
	"They’re going to take away thousands of jobs.",
	"It’s very bad for us.",
	"So under President Trump, here’s what would happen:",
	"The head of Ford will call me back, I would say within an hour after I told them the bad news.",
	"But it could be he’d want to be cool, and he’ll wait until the next day.",
	"You know, they want to be a little cool.",
	"And he’ll say, Please, please, please.",
	"He’ll beg for a little while, and I’ll say, No interest.",
	"Then he’ll call all sorts of political people, and I’ll say, Sorry, fellas.",
	"No interest, because I don’t need anybody’s money.",
	"I don’t need anybody’s money.",
	"I’m using my own money.",
	"I’m not using the lobbyists.",
	"I’m not using donors.",
	"And by the way, I’m not even saying that in a — that’s the kind of mindset, that’s the kind of thinking you need for this country.",
	"So — because we got to make the country rich.",
	"Somebody said, Oh, that’s crass.",
	"We got $18 trillion in debt.",
	"We got nothing but problems.",
	"We got a military that needs equipment all over the place.",
	"We got nuclear weapons that are obsolete.",
	"We’ve got Social Security that’s going to be destroyed if somebody like me doesn’t bring money into the country.",
	"All these other people want to cut the hell out of it.",
	"I’m not going to cut it at all; I’m going to bring money in, and we’re going to save it.",
	"But here’s what’s going to happen:",
	"After I’m called by 30 friends of mine who contributed to different campaigns, after I’m called by all of the special interests and by the — the donors and by the lobbyists — and they have zero chance at convincing me, zero — I’ll get a call the next day from the head of Ford.",
	"Please reconsider, I’ll say no.",
	"President, we’ve decided to move the plant back to the United States, and we’re not going to build it in Mexico.",
	"They have no choice.",
	"They have no choice.",
	"There are hundreds of things like that.",
	"I’ll give you another example.TRUMP: Saudi Arabia, they make $1 billion a day.",
	"$1 billion a day.",
	"I love the Saudis.",
	"Many are in this building.",
	"They make a billion dollars a day.",
	"Whenever they have problems, we send over the ships.",
	"We say we’re gonna protect.",
	"What are we doing? They’ve got nothing but money.",
	"If the right person asked them, they’d pay a fortune.",
	"They wouldn’t be there except for us.",
	"And believe me, you look at the border with Yemen.",
	"You remember Obama a year ago, Yemen was a great victory.",
	"Two weeks later, the place was blown up.",
	"Everybody got out — and they kept our equipment.",
	"They always keep our equipment.",
	"We ought to send used equipment, right? They always keep our equipment.",
	"We ought to send some real junk, because, frankly, it would be — we ought to send our surplus.",
	"We’re always losing this gorgeous brand-new stuff.",
	"But look at that border with Saudi Arabia.",
	"Do you really think that these people are interested in Yemen? Saudi Arabia without us is gone.",
	"And I’m the one that made all of the right predictions about Iraq.",
	"You know, all of these politicians that I’m running against now — it’s so nice to say I’m running as opposed to if I run, if I run.",
	"But all of these politicians that I’m running against now, they’re trying to disassociate.",
	"I mean, you looked at Bush, it took him five days to answer the question on Iraq.",
	"He couldn’t answer the question.",
	"I said, Is he intelligent?",
	"Then I looked at Rubio.",
	"He was unable to answer the question, is Iraq a good thing or bad thing? He didn’t know.",
	"He couldn’t answer the question.",
	"How are these people gonna lead us? How are we gonna — how are we gonna go back and make it great again? We can’t.",
	"They don’t have a clue.",
	"They can’t lead us.",
	"They can’t even answer simple questions.",
	"But Saudi Arabia is in big, big trouble.",
	"Now, thanks to fracking and other things, the oil is all over the place.",
	"And I used to say it, there are ships at sea, and this was during the worst crisis, that were loaded up with oil, and the cartel kept the price up, because, again, they were smarter than our leaders.",
	"They were smarter than our leaders.",
	"There is so much wealth out there that can make our country so rich again, and therefore make it great again.",
	"Because we need money.",
	"We have to do it.",
	"And we need the right people.",
	"So Ford will come back.",
	"They’ll all come back.",
	"And I will say this, this is going to be an election, in my opinion, that’s based on competence.",
	"Somebody said — thank you, darlin’.",
	"Somebody said to me the other day, a reporter, a very nice reporter, But, Mr.",
	"Trump, you’re not a nice person.",
	"But actually I am.",
	"I think I am a nice person.",
	"People that know me, like me.",
	"Does my family like me? I think so, right.",
	"Look at my family.",
	"I’m proud of my family.",
	"By the way, speaking of my family, Melania, Barron, Kai, Donnie, Don, Vanessa, Tiffany, Evanka did a great job.",
	"Did she do a great job?",
	"Jared, Laura and Eric, I’m very proud of my family.",
	"They’re a great family.",
	"So the reporter said to me the other day, But, Mr.",
	"Trump, you’re not a nice person.",
	"How can you get people to vote for you?",
	"I said, I don’t know.",
	"I said, I think that number one, I am a nice person.",
	"I give a lot of money away to charities and other things.",
	"I think I’m actually a very nice person.",
	"But, I said, This is going to be an election that’s based on competence, because people are tired of these nice people.",
	"And they’re tired of being ripped off by everybody in the world.",
	"And they’re tired of spending more money on education than any nation in the world per capita, than any nation in the world, and we are 26th in the world, 25 countries are better than us in education.",
	"And some of them are like third world countries.",
	"But we’re becoming a third word country, because of our infrastructure, our airports, our roads, everything.",
	"So one of the things I did, and I said, you know what I’ll do.",
	"Because a lot of people said, He’ll never run.",
	"Number one, he won’t want to give up his lifestyle.",
	"They’re right about that, but I’m doing it.",
	"Number two, I’m a private company, so nobody knows what I’m worth.",
	"And the one thing is that when you run, you have to announce and certify to all sorts of governmental authorities your net worth.",
	"So I said, That’s OK.",
	"I’m proud of my net worth.",
	"I’ve done an amazing job.",
	"I started off — thank you — I started off in a small office with my father in Brooklyn and Queens, and my father said — and I love my father.",
	"I learned so much.",
	"He was a great negotiator.",
	"I learned so much just sitting at his feet playing with blocks listening to him negotiate with subcontractors.",
	"But I learned a lot.",
	"But he used to say, Donald, don’t go into Manhattan.",
	"That’s the big leagues.",
	"We don’t know anything about that.",
	"I said, I gotta go into Manhattan.",
	"I gotta build those big buildings.",
	"I gotta do it, Dad.",
	"I’ve gotta do it.",
	"And after four or five years in Brooklyn, I ventured into Manhattan and did a lot of great deals — the Grand Hyatt Hotel.",
	"I was responsible for the convention center on the west side.",
	"I did a lot of great deals, and I did them early and young.",
	"And now I’m building all over the world, and I love what I’m doing.",
	"But they all said, a lot of the pundits on television, Well, Donald will never run, and one of the main reasons is he’s private and he’s probably not as successful as everybody thinks.",
	"So I said to myself, you know, nobody’s ever going to know unless I run, because I’m really proud of my success.",
	"I’ve employed — I’ve employed tens of thousands of people over my lifetime.",
	"So a large accounting firm and my accountants have been working for months, because it’s big and complex, and they’ve put together a statement, a financial statement, just a summary.",
	"But everything will be filed eventually with the government, and we don’t extensions or anything.",
	"We’ll be filing it right on time.",
	"We don’t need anything.",
	"And it was even reported incorrectly yesterday, because they said, He had assets of $9 billion.",
	"So I said, No, that’s the wrong number.",
	"That’s the wrong number.",
	"So they put together this.",
	"And before I say it, I have to say this.",
	"I made it the old-fashioned way.",
	"You know, it’s real estate.",
	"It’s labor, and it’s unions good and some bad and lots of people that aren’t in unions, and it’s all over the place and building all over the world.",
	"And I have assets — big accounting firm, one of the most highly respected — 9 billion 240 million dollars.",
	"And I have liabilities of about $500 million.",
	"That’s long-term debt, very low interest rates.",
	"In fact, one of the big banks came to me and said, Donald, you don’t have enough borrowings.",
	"Could we loan you $4 billion? I said, I don’t need it.",
	"I don’t want it.",
	"And I’ve been there.",
	"I don’t want it.",
	"But in two seconds, they give me whatever I wanted.",
	"So I have a total net worth, and now with the increase, it’ll be well-over $10 billion.",
	"But here, a total net worth of — net worth, not assets, not — a net worth, after all debt, after all expenses, the greatest assets — Trump Tower, 1290 Avenue of the Americas, Bank of America building in San Francisco, 40 Wall Street, sometimes referred to as the Trump building right opposite the New York — many other places all over the world.",
	"So the total is $8,737,540,00.",
	"Now I’m not doing that…",
	"I’m not doing that to brag, because you know what? I don’t have to brag.",
	"I don’t have to, believe it or not.",
	"I’m doing that to say that that’s the kind of thinking our country needs.",
	"We need that thinking.",
	"We have the opposite thinking.",
	"We have people that don’t have it.",
	"We have people that are morally corrupt.",
	"We have people that are selling this country down the drain.",
	"So I put together this statement, and the only reason I’m telling you about it today is because we really do have to get going, because if we have another three or four years — you know, we’re at $8 trillion now.",
	"We’re soon going to be at $20 trillion.TRUMP: According to the economists — who I’m not big believers in, but, nevertheless, this is what they’re saying — that $24 trillion — we’re very close — that’s the point of no return.",
	"We will be there soon.",
	"That’s when we become Greece.",
	"That’s when we become a country that’s unsalvageable.",
	"And we’re gonna be there very soon.",
	"We’re gonna be there very soon.",
	"So, just to sum up, I would do various things very quickly.",
	"I would repeal and replace the big lie, Obamacare.",
	"I would build a great wall, and nobody builds walls better than me, believe me, and I’ll build them very inexpensively, I will build a great, great wall on our southern border.",
	"And I will have Mexico pay for that wall.",
	"Nobody would be tougher on ISIS than Donald Trump.",
	"I will find — within our military, I will find the General Patton or I will find General MacArthur, I will find the right guy.",
	"I will find the guy that’s going to take that military and make it really work.",
	"Nobody, nobody will be pushing us around.",
	"I will stop Iran from getting nuclear weapons.",
	"And we won’t be using a man like Secretary Kerry that has absolutely no concept of negotiation, who’s making a horrible and laughable deal, who’s just being tapped along as they make weapons right now, and then goes into a bicycle race at 72 years old, and falls and breaks his leg.",
	"I won’t be doing that.",
	"And I promise I will never be in a bicycle race.",
	"That I can tell you.",
	"I will immediately terminate President Obama’s illegal executive order on immigration, immediately.",
	"Fully support and back up the Second Amendment.",
	"Now, it’s very interesting.",
	"Today I heard it.",
	"Through stupidity, in a very, very hard core prison, interestingly named Clinton, two vicious murderers, two vicious people escaped, and nobody knows where they are.",
	"And a woman was on television this morning, and she said, You know, Mr.",
	"Trump, and she was telling other people, and I actually called her, and she said, You know, Mr.",
	"Trump, I always was against guns.",
	"I didn’t want guns.",
	"And now since this happened — it’s up in the prison area — my husband and I are finally in agreement, because he wanted the guns.",
	"We now have a gun on every table.",
	"We’re ready to start shooting.",
	"I said, Very interesting.",
	"So protect the Second Amendment.",
	"End — end Common Core.",
	"Common Core should — it is a disaster.",
	"Bush is totally in favor of Common Core.",
	"I don’t see how he can possibly get the nomination.",
	"He’s weak on immigration.",
	"He’s in favor of Common Core.",
	"How the hell can you vote for this guy? You just can’t do it.",
	"We have to end — education has to be local.",
	"Rebuild the country’s infrastructure.",
	"Nobody can do that like me.",
	"It will be done on time, on budget, way below cost, way below what anyone ever thought.",
	"I look at the roads being built all over the country, and I say I can build those things for one-third.",
	"What they do is unbelievable, how bad.",
	"You know, we’re building on Pennsylvania Avenue, the Old Post Office, we’re converting it into one of the world’s great hotels.",
	"It’s gonna be the best hotel in Washington, D.C.",
	"We got it from the General Services Administration in Washington.",
	"It was the most highly sought after — or one of them, but I think the most highly sought after project in the history of General Services.",
	"People were shocked, Trump got it.",
	"Well, I got it for two reasons.",
	"Number one, we’re really good.",
	"Number two, we had a really good plan.",
	"And I’ll add in the third, we had a great financial statement.",
	"Because the General Services, who are terrific people, by the way, and talented people, they wanted to do a great job.",
	"And they wanted to make sure it got built.",
	"So we have to rebuild our infrastructure, our bridges, our roadways, our airports.",
	"You come into La Guardia Airport, it’s like we’re in a third world country.",
	"You look at the patches and the 40-year-old floor.",
	"They throw down asphalt, and they throw.",
	"You look at these airports, we are like a third world country.",
	"And I come in from China and I come in from Qatar and I come in from different places, and they have the most incredible airports in the world.",
	"You come to back to this country and you have LAX, disaster.",
	"You have all of these disastrous airports.",
	"We have to rebuild our infrastructure.",
	"Save Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security without cuts.",
	"Have to do it.",
	"Get rid of the fraud.",
	"Get rid of the waste and abuse, but save it.",
	"People have been paying it for years.",
	"And now many of these candidates want to cut it.",
	"You save it by making the United States, by making us rich again, by taking back all of the money that’s being lost.",
	"Renegotiate our foreign trade deals.",
	"Reduce our $18 trillion in debt, because, believe me, we’re in a bubble.",
	"We have artificially low interest rates.",
	"We have a stock market that, frankly, has been good to me, but I still hate to see what’s happening.",
	"We have a stock market that is so bloated.",
	"Be careful of a bubble because what you’ve seen in the past might be small potatoes compared to what happens.",
	"So be very, very careful.",
	"And strengthen our military and take care of our vets.",
	"Sadly, the American dream is dead.",
	"But if I get elected president I will bring it back bigger and better and stronger than ever before, and we will make America great again.",
	"Thank you very much.",
